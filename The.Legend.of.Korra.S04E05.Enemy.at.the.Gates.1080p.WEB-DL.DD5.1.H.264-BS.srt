1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,340
- Earth.

2
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,875
Fire.

3
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:11,643
Air.

4
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:12,945
Water.

5
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:17,182
Only the avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:20,386
And bring balance
to the world.

7
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,925
- After three years,
kuvira has united

8
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:28,160
The former earth kingdom states

9
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:30,396
Under her new
earth empire banner.

10
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:32,498
But one holdout remains:
Zaofu.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,499
During that same time,

12
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,501
Asami rebuilt the company
her father created

13
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:37,569
And helped redesign
the city's infrastructure.

14
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:40,072
And most recently, the
airbender kids found the avatar.

15
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:43,042
Korra rid herself of
the residual poison in her body

16
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:46,378
And is ready to return
to action.

17
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,369
- We have an emergency.

18
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,774
- I'll contact president raiko.

19
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,911
He'll send the united forces.

20
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:23,082
- Call whomever you want, but
they'll never make it in time.

21
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:28,053
Kuvira's already here,
and she brought her entire army.

22
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:39,531
- By this time tomorrow,

23
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:40,933
My mother will have signed
our treaty,

24
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:43,836
And the earth empire
will finally be united.

25
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:45,070
- Don't get ahead of yourself.

26
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:49,007
Securing your hometown
won't be like every other city.

27
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:52,711
- Zaofu stopped being my home
long ago.

28
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,047
I'm ready to take it by force.

29
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:55,781
- No.

30
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,950
The eyes of the world
are on us now.

31
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:00,018
We must do this right.

32
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,120
That's why we need bolin.

33
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:04,623
- Do you really think
we can rely on him?

34
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,058
- Su trusts him.

35
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,893
She'll listen to him.

36
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:11,130
- Are you sure we should be
going to zaofu?

37
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,899
Dad wanted us to bring you
back to republic city.

38
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:16,635
- If kuvira's heading to zaofu,
so am I.

39
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,438
She needs to know
that the avatar is back.

40
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,873
The world needs to know.

41
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,508
- Whoo-hoo!

42
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,809
Avatar fight!

43
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,678
This is going to be awesome!

44
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,114
- Meelo,
there's not gonna be a fight.

45
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:30,549
Kuvira saved my dad.

46
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:31,750
She was a captain in su's guard.

47
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,852
I think she can be
reasoned with.

48
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,587
- What?
No fight?

49
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:38,690
Why did we go through all
that trouble to save you

50
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:42,895
If you're not going to
beat someone up?

51
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,133
- Zhu li,
is this thing on?

52
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:49,334
- We're rolling, sir.

53
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,638
- Okay, I'm varrick of varrick
industries international,

54
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,942
And this is
spirit vine experiment 3-02

55
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:59,077
Hand me the thing.

56
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,980
[grunting]

57
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:06,618
In this stasis capsule is a
preserved spirit vine sample

58
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,789
Weighing approximately
two zhu lis.

59
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:14,259
I have postulated
that these spirit vines

60
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,929
Are a form of pure energy
that's unstable

61
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:19,731
In what we call
"typical earth conditions."

62
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,801
This machine should transfer
the energy from the vine

63
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,804
Into a battery
using electrical currents,

64
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,072
Reverse magnetic polarity,

65
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:33,612
And a little-known phenomenon
I call the varri-effect.

66
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,815
It's working.

67
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:40,052
It's registering five varricks
of power...

68
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:44,690
Now seven varricks.

69
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,727
Whoa.
What is this?

70
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,697
What's going on?

71
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:52,965
- Oh!

72
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:53,899
- Ahh!

73
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,734
Zhu li,
shut it down.

74
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,203
There are too many varricks.

75
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,715
Ahh!

76
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:12,217
- Ahh!

77
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:14,987
Sir...

78
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:17,122
- [grunting]

79
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,023
You're too heavy.

80
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:21,693
You know, you could stand
to lose a few zhu lis.

81
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,729
- I think you're just weak, sir.

82
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:25,264
Pull harder.

83
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,699
- [grunting]

84
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:31,003
Both: Ahh!

85
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,707
- Varrick,
you saved me.

86
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,142
- Of course I saved you.

87
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:40,646
I can't clean this place up
by myself.

88
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:41,346
Grab a broom.

89
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,315
- What happened?
Were we attacked?

90
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:47,019
- No, we were spirit-vined,
but don't worry.

91
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:49,921
I'm putting the kibosh
on this project.

92
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:50,756
- No, you're not.

93
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:53,959
Do you realize what we can do
with this kind of power?

94
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:54,960
- Yes, I do.

95
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,862
And that's why we've got to
put an end to it.

96
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:58,597
What if it fell into
the wrong hands?

97
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,899
- Since when does that matter
to you?

98
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,301
- I know.
It's not like me, right?

99
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,702
Usually,
I look at a project like this,

100
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:07,272
And all I think is, "wow, I can
make a ton of money off this."

101
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:12,311
But recently, I've been having
these strange feelings inside.

102
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:15,414
It's like I'm...
Concerned with others.

103
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,816
And there's this nagging voice
in my head

104
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:21,019
Constantly telling me
what's right from wrong.

105
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,922
- I believe that voice
is your conscience, sir.

106
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,424
- Well, I'm the other voice
in your head,

107
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:29,261
And I'm telling you,
you will continue this project.

108
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:30,062
- Sorry, no.

109
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:33,365
I just really got to stand
my ground on this one.

110
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,099
Whoa!

111
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,268
- Now there's a voice in my head
telling me

112
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,969
To drop you on the tracks.

113
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,205
Should I listen?

114
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,073
- No, no.

115
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:43,942
Head voices are liars.
What do head voices know?

116
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,243
I'll work on the project.

117
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,846
Please don't drop me.

118
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,049
Ahh!

119
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,932
- Asami, you came.

120
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,904
I'm here to return these.

121
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,706
- You never opened them.

122
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,774
- Stop writing me.

123
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:19,911
I never want to see
or hear from you again.

124
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,279
- Please,
just let me say one thing,

125
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,349
Then I'll never contact you
again.

126
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:28,787
I can't forgive myself for all
the horrible things I've done,

127
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,756
And I never expect you
to forgive me.

128
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:34,860
I tore our family apart
and destroyed our good name.

129
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:35,894
But in a life of regret,

130
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:41,700
You're the one thing I look
back on that makes me smile.

131
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,937
I just want you to know
I'm so proud of you, asami.

132
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:51,643
You are the greatest thing
I ever created.

133
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,321
- Am I in trouble?

134
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:06,124
- No.
In fact, I have good news.

135
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:09,327
We want you to be part
of our inner circle.

136
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,363
- Inner circle! No way! Yes!

137
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:15,066
Ahem,
that is a great honor.

138
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,201
What does it mean,
exactly?

139
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,103
- It means you've proven
your worth.

140
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,172
We're so close to uniting
the empire,

141
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:23,208
But su has some resentment
towards me and baatar

142
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,509
That might cloud her judgment

143
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:27,279
And stop her from making
a wise decision.

144
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,948
We believe you can help her
see clearly.

145
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,049
- I can do that.

146
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,384
By the time I'm finished
telling her

147
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:35,320
All the great things we've done,
she'll be begging to join.

148
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,889
- Good,
because we're here.

149
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,360
- Aren't all these troops
gonna send the wrong message?

150
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,596
- The army is here
to project strength.

151
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:47,999
You're here to present peace.

152
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,212
- Opal,
you're here too.

153
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:02,681
- No,
you've chosen your side.

154
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,050
- Sides?
There shouldn't be sides.

155
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:08,086
I know, why don't we all stand
in a circle, huh,

156
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,120
Maybe hold hands?

157
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,255
- I'm not giving up zaofu.

158
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:12,624
I don't care if you brought
your entire army.

159
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:15,327
- Su, I didn't bring my army
to threaten you.

160
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,529
I wanted to show you
all that your son and I

161
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:18,563
Have accomplished.

162
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,065
- You must realize
what you're doing

163
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:23,802
Goes against everything your
father and I tried to teach you.

164
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:26,304
- Son, you belong here.

165
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:26,938
- Why?

166
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,608
So that I can go on living
in your shadow?

167
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,009
- Don't say that.

168
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,211
Can't you see
she's brainwashed you.

169
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:36,014
- Ha,
I didn't brainwash him.

170
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,048
I set him free.

171
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,550
And now he's accomplished
more with me

172
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,018
Than he ever could have
with you.

173
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,256
- Okay, guys, obviously,
there's a lot of personal,

174
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:45,223
Painful history here.

175
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,193
So what do say we just all
forget about that stuff, huh?

176
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,561
I mean,
that's the past.

177
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:50,996
Right, wing?
Right, wei?

178
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,198
You guys know
what I'm talking about.

179
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,767
High five.

180
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,469
All right.
No, it's cool.

181
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:59,304
You know what I think
we need to do?

182
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,472
Focus on the future.

183
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:02,507
And the future is bright.
Let me tell you.

184
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:05,176
I've seen it.
Yeah, saw it last month.

185
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,345
We went to this town
that had nothing.

186
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,548
Most of the people there
had never even seen

187
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,949
A satomobile before.

188
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:14,185
But now they have
two satomobiles,

189
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,054
Running water,
and a magnet train

190
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,589
That goes right through
their town.

191
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,291
I mean,
how awesome is that?

192
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:21,693
- They might have been happy
when you first arrived,

193
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,528
But I've seen what happens
after you leave.

194
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,364
Citizens are forced to work
as slave labor.

195
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:29,000
Dissenters are sent off
to who knows where.

196
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,135
- You're wrong, opal.

197
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,003
Now, I don't know
what you think you've seen,

198
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,339
But I'm giving you
the 100% bolin guarantee

199
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:36,007
That we're making
the earth empire

200
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,108
A better place to live.

201
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,145
- I can't believe
you brought bolin here

202
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:42,147
To try to sway us.

203
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:42,647
Leave.

204
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,450
Zaofu will never accept you
as their leader.

205
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:46,985
- Then you leave me no choice.

206
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:50,455
You have 24 hours to agree
to join the empire,

207
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:54,025
Or we take the city by force.

208
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,034
- I see it.
Zaofu.

209
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,436
We made it.

210
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:10,075
And a bunch of other people
are here too.

211
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,109
- Oh, no.

212
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,545
I hope we're not too late.

213
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,182
- Korra?

214
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,584
I can't believe it.
Where have you been?

215
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:22,053
You disappeared.
Everyone was so worried.

216
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,755
, I'll tell you the whole story
later.

217
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:27,125
Right now,
I want to help you stop kuvira.

218
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,394
What can I do?

219
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,562
- You were just bluffing, right?

220
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:33,531
I mean, you're not really
going to attack zaofu...Are you?

221
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,768
- When people don't cooperate,
we must find other ways

222
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,570
Of convincing them to join.

223
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:39,771
- Other ways?

224
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,707
How many times have we used
these other ways

225
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:43,541
In the past?

226
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:45,410
- It's not for you
to worry about.

227
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:47,545
- So...
What does happen

228
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:50,448
To all of those towns
and villages after we leave?

229
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,451
I just realized
I've never really gone back

230
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,486
And checked on them.

231
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,421
- Those people
are my loyal subjects,

232
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:59,624
And they contribute
to the empire however I see fit.

233
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,259
Now that you're in
the inner circle,

234
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,595
You're going to have to accept
some hard truths.

235
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:07,499
- Maybe I'm not really
an inner-circle kind of guy.

236
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,368
Or--or maybe
we don't take over zaofu.

237
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,003
We could just let them be
on their own,

238
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,772
Then yay,
the empire's united.

239
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,273
Congratulations to us.

240
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,542
- I didn't know
your personal feelings for opal

241
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:20,311
Were stronger than
your loyalty to me.

242
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,280
Zaofu will join us.

243
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,182
The only thing
I'm second-guessing

244
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,750
Is the decision
to bring you along.

245
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:29,721
Maybe you need to spend
some time in a reeducation camp.

246
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:32,290
- I thought that's where
we send people

247
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,325
To learn new trade skills.

248
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:36,194
- Hard truths, bolin.

249
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,997
- Your loyalty
seems to be wavering.

250
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:42,834
- No, no,
I'm totally on your side,

251
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:47,038
Completely 100% loyal.

252
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:53,445
- How did things get so bad
between you and kuvira?

253
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:55,213
I thought she was your protege?

254
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,748
- She was more than that.

255
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,249
She was like a daughter to me.

256
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,685
I took her in
when she was eight years old

257
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:01,920
And nourished her talents.

258
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,789
Kuvira was smart,
a natural leader,

259
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,358
And quickly rose
through the ranks.

260
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,494
I saw myself in her.

261
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:10,628
- What happened?

262
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,199
- Three years ago, after
the fall of the earth queen,

263
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:17,602
Raiko and tenzin
came to see me.

264
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:18,770
- The earth kingdom is in chaos.

265
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:21,406
There's a vacuum of power,
and I'm concerned about

266
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,309
What will happen
if someone doesn't take control

267
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,143
Of the situation.

268
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,678
- And do you think I should be
the one?

269
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,947
- You're the perfect person
to take charge.

270
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,583
The world leaders trust you,
and as a beifong,

271
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,585
You have credibility
in the earth kingdom.

272
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,286
- I'm honored
that you thought of me,

273
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:38,323
But I'm not interested
in imposing my ideals

274
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:39,991
On an entire nation.

275
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,760
I'm afraid I can't help you.

276
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,362
- Suyin,
I know this isn't my place,

277
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,864
But I think you should do this.

278
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:48,266
Zaofu has always been a beacon
of modern progress,

279
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,769
And now you can share that
with everyone.

280
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,403
- What would you have me do,

281
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,706
March into ba sing
se with an army?

282
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,174
We'd be seen as conquerors

283
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:58,243
And greeted with nothing
but war.

284
00:12:58,245 --> 00:12:59,410
- There are already wars.

285
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,813
The earth queen nearly destroyed
our nation.

286
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:04,849
This is our opportunity
to change things.

287
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:08,153
- It's not going to happen.

288
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,255
I didn't realize at the time,

289
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:15,260
But that moment created a rift
between us.

290
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,629
Kuvira turned my own son
against me.

291
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:21,533
And together they plotted
behind my back.

292
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,168
What do you think you're doing?

293
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,670
- We're doing what you
don't have the guts to do.

294
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,506
We're going to ba sing se
to help bring order back

295
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:29,574
To the earth kingdom.

296
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,910
- No.
You will stay here.

297
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,745
- And who's going to stop me?

298
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:36,414
Your security force
was more than happy

299
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,215
To join my cause.

300
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,350
They're some of
the best fighters in the world,

301
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,885
And they are tired
of being treated

302
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,487
Like exotic birds in your cage.

303
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,924
- If you leave now,
you will never be welcomed back.

304
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:49,994
- When I choose to return,
it will be on my own terms.

305
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,298
- Kuvira and baatar left
that day with varrick,

306
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,901
My security force, and a few
of zaofu's wealthiest citizens.

307
00:13:56,903 --> 00:14:00,939
After kuvira proved herself
by stabilizing ba sing se,

308
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,007
Raiko and the other world
leaders made her

309
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,910
The provisional head
of the earth kingdom.

310
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,879
Once she refused to step down,

311
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,647
I knew it was only
a matter of time

312
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,783
Until she made her way
back here.

313
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:13,885
- I want to fix this.
- You can.

314
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:17,288
Go into the avatar state
and demolish her army.

315
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,258
Remove kuvira from power
once and for all.

316
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,727
- Fighting is something
the old me would do,

317
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,630
But that always
made things worse.

318
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,465
Let me talk with kuvira.

319
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:28,967
Maybe I can reason with her.

320
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:32,871
- Kuvira doesn't listen
to reason.

321
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,389
- I can't believe kuvira
locked me in here

322
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,523
Like a prisoner.

323
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:53,625
I'm not feeling well.

324
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:55,360
I think I'm running out of air.

325
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:56,861
Zhu li,
hold your breath.

326
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,062
- I'm not holding my breath.

327
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,999
- Great.
Now we're both gonna die.

328
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,700
- Varrick.

329
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:03,368
Varrick.

330
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,838
- Augh,
and the head voices are back.

331
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,040
Bolin,
thank goodness you're here.

332
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,576
Where did that hatch come from?
Forget the hatch.

333
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,811
There's something important
I've got to tell you.

334
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,680
- Well,
there's something important

335
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:17,649
I've got tell you too.

336
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,717
Both:
Kuvira's crazy.

337
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:20,618
- How'd you find out?

338
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,887
- When I refused to build her
a super weapon,

339
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:23,922
She threatened my life.

340
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,324
- She threatened me too,
and she's threatening zaofu.

341
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,459
And it turns out
she's been threatening villages

342
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,460
This whole time.

343
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:30,795
We've got to get out of here.

344
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:34,432
- I couldn't agree more, kid.

345
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,310
- We have an unexpected guest.

346
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:48,780
The avatar is here to see you.

347
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,384
- Korra, it's such an honor
to see you again.

348
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:56,587
The last I heard, you were
still healing in the south pole.

349
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,424
- Well,
I'm feeling much better now.

350
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:00,692
- That's wonderful news.

351
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:02,994
- I'm here to ask you
to back down.

352
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,063
Please,
take your army and leave.

353
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:10,401
- I think we both know
that's not going to happen.

354
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,443
- I can't let you take zaofu.

355
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:21,112
- Look, I was tasked
with bringing stability

356
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,613
To the earth kingdom.

357
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,549
Zaofu is the last holdout.

358
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,084
Why should I treat it
differently

359
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,318
Than any other state?

360
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,853
- What you're doing isn't right.

361
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:31,756
- I understand you're just
trying to do su a favor,

362
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,125
But you can't come to me
as I'm on the verge

363
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,794
Of reuniting my nation
and tell me to stop.

364
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:40,098
The world was descending
into chaos while you were gone.

365
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,935
In order to fix it, I had
to make some tough decisions.

366
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:45,370
- I know what that's like.

367
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,105
I've had plenty of people
mad at me

368
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,773
About decisions I've made.

369
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:49,640
- Exactly.

370
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,642
Korra,
if you really want to help,

371
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:55,580
Go back to su and try to talk
some sense into her.

372
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,315
Let's call a temporary truce.

373
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:00,218
I won't make any moves
until you talk to her

374
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,285
And get back to me.

375
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:04,922
- Maybe that will be
for the best.

376
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,090
- Have you seen bolin?

377
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:10,228
- He came by to see varrick,
but we turned him away.

378
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,563
- Open the door.

379
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:18,403
We have some fugitives to catch.

380
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,541
- Okay, I say we go up
and around the mountains

381
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,243
And sneak into zaofu
from the rear.

382
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,778
- We're not going to zaofu.

383
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,912
That place is doomed.

384
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,180
We've got to head
to republic city.

385
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:31,783
- What? No. No, no, no.
We've got to help here.

386
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:34,018
- We'll be helping
by warning the world

387
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,821
About kuvira's potential
super weapon.

388
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:37,922
- Well,
that is helping,

389
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:40,258
But it's a completely
different type of helping.

390
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,593
Hmm, let me think about this.

391
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,595
Ahh!

392
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,264
- Argh!

393
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,066
- Ahh!

394
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,903
- Argh!

395
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,672
Ahh! Ahh!

396
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,111
That's not the flamethrower.

397
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,880
What idiot designed
these things?

398
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:03,815
- You did, sir.

399
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:06,818
- Less lecturing,
more saving my life.

400
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,619
- Ugh!

401
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,955
Ahh!

402
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,224
Argh!

403
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:14,792
- Oh!

404
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,527
- Argh!

405
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:19,597
- Ahh!

406
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,132
Ugh.

407
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:26,304
Ahh!

408
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:30,608
Argh!

409
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,317
Argh!

410
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,153
- Hey,
I think I figured it out.

411
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,323
- Ahh!

412
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:48,926
Sir, you're making this
very difficult.

413
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:50,761
Ahh!

414
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:54,031
- Argh!

415
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,900
Yah!

416
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,638
- Augh!

417
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,908
- Ahh!

418
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,146
- Argh!

419
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,852
Argh!

420
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,254
- Augh!

421
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,823
Ahh!

422
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,895
- Ahh!

423
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,830
Ahh-ahh!

424
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,806
Argh!

425
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,008
- Stop.

426
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,844
Turn yourself over or else.

427
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,847
- Thanks a lot, zhu li.

428
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,989
- You came back.

429
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:52,890
- When I first came here,

430
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,159
It was because I wanted
to tell you face-to-face

431
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:58,930
That I never wanted to see
or hear from you again.

432
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:00,765
I wanted my words to hurt you,

433
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,935
So that you would know
how you hurt me.

434
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:04,735
- I'm sorry.

435
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:08,839
- But when I saw you,
it wasn't anger I felt.

436
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,174
It was sadness.

437
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:14,378
You tainted our past and
destroyed our future together.

438
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,446
- I want to make amends.

439
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:19,317
- I'm not sure I'll ever be able
to forgive you,

440
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:23,387
But that doesn't mean
I shouldn't try.

441
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:27,091
I thought we could play
some pai sho,

442
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:29,227
Like we used to.

443
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:32,630
- Nothing would make me happier.

444
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,072
[together]
augh!

445
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,942
- Don't torture us.

446
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:47,745
- Send these three away
on the next train.

447
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:51,616
Bolin and zhu li will be going
to the reeducation camp

448
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,251
For our most severe dissenters.

449
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:57,121
And you will continue work
on the spirit energy project

450
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:59,890
Under close,
armed supervision.

451
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:03,127
I want it weaponized
immediately.

452
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,962
- Please,
have mercy on me.

453
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:08,232
Don't send me away.
Take me back.

454
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:08,966
- Why would I?

455
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:13,304
- Because my only mistake was
being loyal to the wrong person.

456
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:14,872
I was blindly devoted
to varrick,

457
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:17,308
And I looked past all the times
he ridiculed me

458
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:21,445
Or ordered me around or made me
clean his disgusting feet,

459
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,515
Because I thought he possessed
the most brilliant mind

460
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:27,385
In the world,
but when I met you,

461
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:28,953
I realized I was wrong.

462
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,756
Compared to you,
varrick's a fool.

463
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,457
- Hey, come on.
I'm right here.

464
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,426
- I believe in everything
you've done,

465
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:37,261
And I believe in your vision.

466
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,530
I want to devote my life to you.

467
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:44,435
I pledge my allegiance to you,
great uniter.

468
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:47,438
- You two could learn something
from her.

469
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,572
Rise, zhu li.

470
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,308
I'll give you another chance.

471
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,443
- Think about what you're doing.

472
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,011
We're partners.

473
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:54,879
We have history.

474
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,947
- I did everything
you ever asked of me,

475
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:59,016
And you never appreciated it.

476
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:01,018
Guards, do the thing.

477
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,055
- No,
not the thing.

478
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:06,857
Zhu li.

479
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,061
- Where's su?
I have to talk to her.

480
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:11,228
- She's not here.

481
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,363
She took wing and wei.

482
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:14,699
They're going to sneak into
kuvira's camp

483
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:16,534
And put an end to this.

484
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:20,037
- No.
