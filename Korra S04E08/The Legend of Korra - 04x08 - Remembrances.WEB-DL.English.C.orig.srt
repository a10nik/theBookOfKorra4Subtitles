1
00:00:08,454 --> 00:00:09,954
Earth.

2
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:11,856
Fire.

3
00:00:11,858 --> 00:00:13,624
Air.

4
00:00:13,626 --> 00:00:14,926
Water.

5
00:00:14,928 --> 00:00:19,163
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements

6
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:23,267
and bring balance to the world.

8
00:00:27,832 --> 00:00:31,021
Avatar Korra is back and
yours truly, Shiro Shinobi,

9
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:32,255
couldn't be more thrilled.

10
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:33,724
It's been my honor to bring you news

11
00:00:33,726 --> 00:00:35,659
of Korra and her friends over the years.

12
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:36,793
So many heart-pounding moments!

13
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:39,796
Who can forget Amon and
his Equalist revolution?

14
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:40,964
I still have nightmares!

15
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:41,898
Then there was that time

16
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,367
I covered the Nuktuk mover premiere.

17
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:45,035
Boy, was that fun. But enough about me.

18
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:47,874
Sit back, relax, and take
a trip down memory lane.

19
00:00:47,994 --> 00:00:51,546
__
__

20
00:00:54,645 --> 00:00:57,381
You know, there's something
about being kidnapped

21
00:00:57,383 --> 00:01:00,884
that makes a guy realize he
needs to get his act together.

22
00:01:00,886 --> 00:01:02,152
Yeah, I agree.

23
00:01:02,154 --> 00:01:04,855
Let's toughen you up.

24
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:08,525
Ahh! I wasn't ready!

25
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:09,226
Wu down!

26
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:12,496
What's going on?

27
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:15,799
Mako, how dare you injure the prince?

28
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:20,470
Would his royal highness
like a cherry-Berry lemonade?

29
00:01:20,472 --> 00:01:23,774
And maybe some of those
sticky dumplings too?

30
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:24,708
Look at you.

31
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,744
You're so weak, "Wu
down" is your catchphrase.

32
00:01:27,746 --> 00:01:29,179
I know, I'm a wimp.

33
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:32,749
But it's not my fault. I was born that way.

34
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:33,850
I'm not like you, Mako.

35
00:01:33,852 --> 00:01:36,586
I wasn't raised by a
pack of cops in the woods.

36
00:01:36,588 --> 00:01:38,221
You don't know anything about me, do you?

37
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:41,358
Yeah, I'm drawing a blank. Why is that?

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,894
How do I not know stuff about you?

39
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,862
Uh... You never asked?

40
00:01:45,864 --> 00:01:47,030
Well, I'm asking now.

41
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:49,566
What's your favorite food?
What's your favorite color?

42
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,768
Is there a special lady in your life?

43
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,537
Not since Korra and I broke up.

44
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:55,772
What? You dated the Avatar? Sit.

45
00:01:55,774 --> 00:01:59,109
You and I need to have a
little gab session right now.

46
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:00,143
How'd you guys first meet?

47
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:02,813
Bolin and I were playing
for the fire ferrets.

48
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:04,514
You were a pro-bender?

49
00:02:04,516 --> 00:02:05,382
Yes.

50
00:02:05,384 --> 00:02:07,617
Will you just let me tell the story?

51
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:08,752
Carry on.

52
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:09,920
Bolin and I grew up dirt poor,

53
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:13,824
so once I became a
pro-bender, I wanted it all:

54
00:02:13,826 --> 00:02:16,226
Riches, fame, accolades.

55
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:18,595
But all that changed when I met Korra.

56
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:21,598
Come here. I want you meet my brother,

57
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Mako.

58
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:23,133
Mako?

59
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:25,535
Wow, I heard you play on the radio.

60
00:02:25,537 --> 00:02:26,537
Come on, Bolin, we're up.

61
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:28,905
Whoa, that was the first time you met?

62
00:02:28,907 --> 00:02:30,273
Kind of rude there, buddy.

63
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:34,544
Know what else is rude? Interrupting.

64
00:02:34,546 --> 00:02:38,515
Korra proved to be an amazing pro-bender,

65
00:02:38,517 --> 00:02:39,249
and a loyal friend.

66
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:44,788
She helped me save Bolin when
he was taken by the Equalists.

67
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,923
After going through
such a crazy experience,

68
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:49,893
I felt like Korra and I
had a powerful connection.

69
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:52,562
So then you smooched her real good?

70
00:02:52,564 --> 00:02:53,830
Huh? Huh?

71
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:56,366
Not exactly.

72
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,504
Ah!

73
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:05,242
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

74
00:03:05,244 --> 00:03:06,042
I didn't see you.

75
00:03:06,044 --> 00:03:08,512
How could you not see me?

76
00:03:08,514 --> 00:03:10,914
I mean, I was ju...

77
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:16,786
I was... I-I... wow.

78
00:03:16,788 --> 00:03:18,622
That was...

79
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:19,122
Wait.

80
00:03:19,124 --> 00:03:20,690
That was the first thing you said to Asami?

81
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:23,326
You really got to work
on your introductions.

82
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,896
Hey, when you got charm like mine,

83
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:27,898
you don't need introductions.

84
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,699
Hanging out with Asami was awesome,

85
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:33,003
but it made things with
Korra... Complicated.

86
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:36,706
So I was thinking we should
spend some time together.

87
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:37,674
Look, I really like you

88
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:42,679
and I think we were meant for each other.

89
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,248
Korra, I'm really sorry but...

90
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,652
I just don't feel the same way about you.

91
00:03:48,654 --> 00:03:50,086
That's harsh, Mako.

92
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:53,089
I know, and the worst part about it is,

93
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:55,158
it wasn't totally true.

94
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,826
We need to talk.

95
00:03:56,828 --> 00:03:57,828
Save your breath.

96
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:00,597
You've already made it
clear how you feel about me.

97
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,932
No, I haven't.

98
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:03,700
What I'm trying to say is...

99
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,802
As much as you drive me crazy,

100
00:04:05,804 --> 00:04:09,906
I also think you're pretty amazing.

101
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:10,908
Hot dog!

102
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:13,009
Smooch city here we come.

103
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:14,344
You player.

104
00:04:14,346 --> 00:04:15,912
Whoa.

105
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:17,681
I thought you were dating Asami.

106
00:04:17,683 --> 00:04:19,082
Tu, get out of here!

107
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:23,119
Naughty Mako. You take
after your grandfather.

108
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:24,321
Guys, grandma,

109
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:26,356
everything wasn't so cut and dry.

110
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:28,925
I wasn't dating Asami.

111
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:29,759
Denial.

112
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:31,895
Okay, maybe I was dating her.

113
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:32,996
It was all very confusing.

114
00:04:32,998 --> 00:04:36,700
But my feelings for Korra became
clear when Tarrlok captured her.

115
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:39,035
It felt like a piece of me was gone.

116
00:04:39,037 --> 00:04:41,671
I was so worried.

117
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:43,006
Are you all right?

118
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:44,407
I'm fine.

119
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,310
I'm glad you're here.

120
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:48,111
Oof.

121
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:50,847
I bet Asami wasn't too happy about that.

122
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:53,617
I've noticed how you treat Korra...

123
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:56,186
How you acted when she was missing.

124
00:04:56,188 --> 00:04:58,054
You have feelings for her, don't you?

125
00:04:58,056 --> 00:04:59,356
Things are crazy right now.

126
00:04:59,358 --> 00:05:01,758
Can we deal with our
relationship problems later?

127
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,893
Well, there might not be any relationship

128
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:05,595
to worry about later.

129
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,230
Asami!

130
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:09,065
Ouch.

131
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:11,735
Yup. Turns out she was right.

132
00:05:11,737 --> 00:05:15,705
It was time to man up and call it quits.

133
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:16,439
Asami,

134
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,309
I'm sorry things got
so messed up between us.

135
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:20,844
But whatever happens today,

136
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:24,180
I want you to know how
much I care about you.

137
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:27,717
I care about you too.

138
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:30,654
Wait, was that supposed to
be you breaking up with her?

139
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:32,422
Yes. That was a breakup.

140
00:05:32,424 --> 00:05:34,157
Didn't sound like a breakup.

141
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,359
It was mutual. We had an understanding.

142
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:37,127
We both knew...

143
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,763
can I just get on with the
rest of my story or what?

144
00:05:39,765 --> 00:05:40,330
Fine.

145
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:42,565
But I hope you weren't
as ambiguous with Korra

146
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:43,900
as you were with Asami.

147
00:05:43,902 --> 00:05:45,735
Trust me, I wasn't.

148
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:47,304
Korra and I ended up stopping Amon together

149
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:51,775
and after that, I was finally
able to tell her how I felt.

150
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:54,277
Exactly how I felt.

151
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:57,080
I love you, Korra.

152
00:06:05,956 --> 00:06:09,826
I love you too.

153
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:10,327
Aww.

154
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,763
And then you two lived happily ever after?

155
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:14,864
Um...

156
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:15,965
Tenzin's just trying to help you

157
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:18,335
become the best Avatar you can be.

158
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,070
Of course you take his side.

159
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:21,237
I'm not taking his side.

160
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:24,341
You know, sometimes I
wonder whose side you're on.

161
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,042
There aren't any sides!

162
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:28,111
How could you take his side?

163
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:29,813
What's with you and sides?

164
00:06:29,815 --> 00:06:31,448
Well, excuse me, officer!

165
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,718
Don't let me stand in the
way of you writing tickets.

166
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,019
I'm just trying to save the world!

167
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,455
Well, I guess that if we're
both putting our jobs first,

168
00:06:38,457 --> 00:06:41,991
maybe there's no room for our relationship.

169
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:43,693
So what?

170
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,129
Are you breaking up with me?

171
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:51,668
Yeah. I guess I am.

172
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,470
Now that's a breakup!

173
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:56,206
After that, I dove into my work.

174
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,174
Someone had been taking out supply ships

175
00:06:58,176 --> 00:06:59,843
heading to the Southern water tribe.

176
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:02,011
Asami's company was one of the victims,

177
00:07:02,013 --> 00:07:04,147
so she and I worked
together to catch the perps.

178
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:08,318
The stakeout was the perfect
way to get my mind off Korra.

179
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,219
It was an intense night.

180
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:12,889
Asami and I discovered the
triads had double crossed us.

181
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:13,891
We barely got away,

182
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:17,160
but by then Asami's warehouse
had been cleared out.

183
00:07:17,162 --> 00:07:20,997
My company... It's over.

184
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:21,831
I give up.

185
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:26,202
Well, I'm not giving up on you.

186
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:31,474
I know, I know. Don't tell me.

187
00:07:31,476 --> 00:07:33,076
I had no right kissing Asami.

188
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,445
No, actually, I'm
completely fine with that.

189
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:36,913
You officially broke up with Korra

190
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,349
and therefore, you're free
to smooch whoever you wish.

191
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:42,118
If only it had been that simple.

192
00:07:46,391 --> 00:07:49,726
Mako, I missed you so much!

193
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:54,397
Korra, hey, I missed you too.

194
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,332
So you're not still mad at me?

195
00:07:56,334 --> 00:08:00,937
We had that fight before
you left, remember?

196
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:01,805
Not really.

197
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:03,373
I got attacked by a dark spirit

198
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,608
and I lost my memory for a little while.

199
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,111
Maybe it hasn't all come back yet.

200
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:11,448
Was it a bad fight?

201
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,251
Ahh...

202
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:16,152
Hmm... No.

203
00:08:16,154 --> 00:08:18,121
No. It wasn't that bad.

204
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,022
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

205
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:20,857
So you were back with Asami,
but then Korra came back

206
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:22,258
and thought you guys were still together

207
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,827
and you didn't tell her you weren't?

208
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:25,028
Just like your grandfather.

209
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,998
Well, me and Asami were never
officially back together.

210
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,066
Really? That again?

211
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:33,336
You know, it seems like you're
so afraid to disappoint anyone

212
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:35,939
that you end up disappointing everyone.

213
00:08:35,941 --> 00:08:39,442
Truer words have never been spoken.

214
00:08:39,444 --> 00:08:40,444
High five!

215
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:43,079
Well, eventually, I did tell Korra

216
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:44,247
but by then she already knew.

217
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:47,150
Why didn't you just tell me
the truth in the first place?

218
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,052
I know I should have, but...

219
00:08:49,054 --> 00:08:50,920
I didn't want to hurt you all over again.

220
00:08:50,922 --> 00:08:54,324
I guess part of me wanted to
forget about the breakup too.

221
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,660
I think we both know that this...

222
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,331
Us... Doesn't work.

223
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,533
You're right.

224
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:05,301
It's over.

225
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:08,304
For real this time.

226
00:09:08,306 --> 00:09:11,307
After harmonic convergence,
the world changed.

227
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:14,611
Team Avatar traveled around
searching for new airbenders.

228
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:18,915
At first, it was awkward
being around Korra and Asami.

229
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:21,050
As you were.

230
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:23,253
Ladies.

231
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:29,325
But then I realized I
had to realize who I was

232
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:30,960
without a lady in my life.

233
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:33,863
I know what that's like.

234
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,332
I mean, to need distance from women,

235
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:39,369
because I have so many all over me,

236
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,537
all the time.

237
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,304
Anyway,

238
00:09:41,306 --> 00:09:43,139
I eventually helped Korra defeat Zaheer

239
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:46,009
and save the airbenders
and we did it as friends.

240
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:49,245
Korra showed me the importance
of putting others before myself.

241
00:09:49,247 --> 00:09:54,584
And whenever I think of her,
she continues to inspire me.

242
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:55,385
Wow.

243
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:56,886
That story is amazing

244
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,988
and I really learned something.

245
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,990
You did? Good.

246
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:03,560
Yeah, I learned that I really
didn't know anything about you.

247
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:04,227
Crazy!

248
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,297
Also, I realized that
ladies are complicated.

249
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:08,431
No offense, grandma.

250
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:09,265
None taken.

251
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:12,302
I better just focus on being a better king.

252
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:14,938
Okay, come at me.

253
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,172
I can take it.

254
00:10:16,174 --> 00:10:19,175
Ah! Wu down!

255
00:10:24,968 --> 00:10:26,635
I brought you some tea.

256
00:10:26,637 --> 00:10:29,838
I thought you might be cold out here.

257
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,307
You're so sweet.

258
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:34,877
Thanks.

259
00:10:36,112 --> 00:10:37,312
Are you okay?

260
00:10:37,314 --> 00:10:39,348
You seem out of sorts.

261
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,115
Sorry.

262
00:10:40,117 --> 00:10:43,018
I've just been thinking
about something Toph said.

263
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,053
She told me that the world doesn't need me

264
00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:48,490
and it's basically pointless
to try to stop Kuvira.

265
00:10:48,492 --> 00:10:49,892
That's ridiculous.

266
00:10:49,894 --> 00:10:51,326
At the time, I thought so too.

267
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:54,930
I figured she was just being
her normal, cranky self,

268
00:10:54,932 --> 00:10:57,433
but I'm beginning to think she had a point.

269
00:10:57,435 --> 00:10:58,934
No, she doesn't.

270
00:10:58,936 --> 00:11:00,602
The world does need you.

271
00:11:00,604 --> 00:11:02,404
You're the Avatar.

272
00:11:02,406 --> 00:11:03,472
But no matter what I do,

273
00:11:03,474 --> 00:11:06,108
the world seems to
always be out of balance.

274
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,011
Growing up, I couldn't
wait to be the Avatar.

275
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:12,281
I thought I was really gonna change things.

276
00:11:12,283 --> 00:11:13,315
I was so naive.

277
00:11:13,317 --> 00:11:16,885
The first time I saw Amon
take someone's bending away,

278
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:18,921
I was terrified.

279
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:21,924
Your firebending is gone.

280
00:11:21,926 --> 00:11:23,559
Forever.

281
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:26,295
Then my worst nightmare came true.

282
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:29,131
Korra!

283
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:30,999
No!

284
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:41,610
I told you I would destroy you.

285
00:11:41,612 --> 00:11:44,313
Korra, you're forgetting about
all the good that happened

286
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:47,416
after you exposed Amon as the fraud he was.

287
00:11:47,418 --> 00:11:51,220
The Equalist movement lost
its leader and its power.

288
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:53,989
Free elections were held
in the united Republic

289
00:11:53,991 --> 00:11:56,325
and non-benders finally had a voice.

290
00:11:56,327 --> 00:12:01,230
People had hope again and
it was all because of you.

291
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:03,131
And I was hopeful too.

292
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:05,367
But that feeling didn't last long.

293
00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:07,102
As soon as I defeated Amon,

294
00:12:07,104 --> 00:12:10,639
a new enemy took his place.

295
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:12,374
I can't I trusted you.

296
00:12:12,376 --> 00:12:14,276
You made me think you
wanted to restore balance

297
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:17,045
with the spirits, but
this... this isn't balance.

298
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:18,180
It's madness!

299
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:19,014
Now let her go.

300
00:12:19,016 --> 00:12:22,284
If you want your friend to
make it out of the spirit world,

301
00:12:22,286 --> 00:12:24,720
you'll open the other portal now.

302
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:27,923
Because of Unalaq, I betrayed Tenzin,

303
00:12:27,925 --> 00:12:28,657
opened the portals,

304
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:32,961
and threw the spirit and
human worlds into chaos.

305
00:12:34,497 --> 00:12:40,936
It was my fault he fused with
Vaatu and became a dark Avatar.

306
00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:52,347
And I was helpless to stop
him from destroying Raava

307
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:56,585
and cutting off my
connection to my past lives.

308
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,423
With Raava gone,

309
00:13:01,425 --> 00:13:06,361
Unalaq and Vaatu became
more powerful than ever.

310
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:11,533
But you became more powerful too.

311
00:13:11,535 --> 00:13:15,470
I mean, you turned into a giant spirit.

312
00:13:15,472 --> 00:13:19,575
Yeah, that was pretty awesome.

313
00:13:20,109 --> 00:13:25,180
And opening the spirit portals
turned out to be a good thing.

314
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:27,616
You brought back the airbenders

315
00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:30,218
and cause a positive shift in the world.

316
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,155
Yes, but Zaheer got airbending too,

317
00:13:33,157 --> 00:13:35,557
and nearly killed me.

318
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:43,465
If it weren't for Zaheer,

319
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:45,334
the earth queen would still be alive.

320
00:13:45,336 --> 00:13:48,136
There would have been no
crisis in the earth kingdom,

321
00:13:48,138 --> 00:13:49,738
and Kuvira wouldn't be in power.

322
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,541
Things are more out of
balance than ever now.

323
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:55,043
Nothing's changed!

324
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:56,411
You're right, Korra.

325
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:57,413
I am?

326
00:13:57,414 --> 00:13:58,213
She is?

327
00:13:58,215 --> 00:14:01,516
It's true, there will
always be new conflicts

328
00:14:01,518 --> 00:14:02,384
and enemies to face.

329
00:14:02,386 --> 00:14:05,320
But the important thing is
to learn from your enemies

330
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:08,423
and better yourself over
time, which you have.

331
00:14:08,425 --> 00:14:11,326
You've changed so much
since you first arrived

332
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:12,461
on air temple island.

333
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:15,130
When you first came
here, you were hotheaded

334
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:16,164
and a bit selfish.

335
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,567
But you've matured into
a thoughtful young woman

336
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:21,470
who puts the needs of
others before herself.

337
00:14:21,472 --> 00:14:24,573
The new air nation is a testament to that.

338
00:14:24,575 --> 00:14:27,409
You sacrificed everything to save them.

339
00:14:27,411 --> 00:14:32,314
You're an inspiration to the world.

340
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:33,348
Thank you both.

341
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,586
I know that this Kuvira problem
is only going to get worse.

342
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:42,190
But no matter what happens,
no matter how crazy things get,

343
00:14:42,192 --> 00:14:46,294
I'll always try to restore balance.

344
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:52,768
And that's when I made a solemn vow

345
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,203
never to eat bark-onion soup again.

346
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:58,206
Been six years, four months, and 14 days...

347
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,875
ugh. I can still taste it.

348
00:14:59,877 --> 00:15:03,445
Does anyone else feel like
throwing themselves overboard?

349
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:04,279
Not me!

350
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:05,781
I've spent the last few hours tuning out

351
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:08,550
all these incredibly boring stories...

352
00:15:08,552 --> 00:15:09,184
Hey!

353
00:15:09,186 --> 00:15:10,619
All the while mentally composing

354
00:15:10,621 --> 00:15:12,921
the most exciting tale ever told,

355
00:15:12,923 --> 00:15:16,391
soon become the greatest mover ever made!

356
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:17,393
I present to you now:

357
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:20,829
Bolin, as Nuktuk, here of the South...

358
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,731
trademark Varrimovers International...

359
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:26,635
in the incredible true story of Bolin!

360
00:15:26,637 --> 00:15:27,836
Hero of the world!

361
00:15:27,838 --> 00:15:32,240
Wait, am I playing Nuktuk,
or is Nuktuk playing me?

362
00:15:32,242 --> 00:15:32,941
Both.

363
00:15:32,943 --> 00:15:34,776
It's your true story, but we'll capitalize

364
00:15:34,778 --> 00:15:37,512
on the audience of the Nuktuk franchise.

365
00:15:37,514 --> 00:15:37,979
Duh.

366
00:15:37,981 --> 00:15:40,582
How can you call me the hero of the world?

367
00:15:40,584 --> 00:15:41,650
I left my friends and family

368
00:15:41,652 --> 00:15:44,019
to join up with a psychotic
dictator who imprisoned me,

369
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:48,490
and now I'm running back home
with my tail between my legs.

370
00:15:48,492 --> 00:15:49,524
Nya, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba.

371
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:51,526
You're emphasizing the wrong story beats.

372
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:52,494
Let me tell it.

373
00:15:52,496 --> 00:15:53,462
The story of Bolin

374
00:15:53,464 --> 00:15:56,431
begins in an exotic port of call.

375
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:59,000
A wise sage, the richest
merchant in the world,

376
00:15:59,002 --> 00:16:01,903
and a handsome devil all
sit on a single pillow

377
00:16:01,905 --> 00:16:03,872
in the living room of a luxury yacht.

378
00:16:03,874 --> 00:16:05,941
How do they all fit on one pillow?

379
00:16:05,943 --> 00:16:07,509
Ooh! Giant pillow!

380
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:08,110
Wrong!

381
00:16:08,112 --> 00:16:10,445
They're all the same man! Me!

382
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:12,948
I try to teach a swami
the power of levitation,

383
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,950
but he's too stupid to understand it,

384
00:16:14,952 --> 00:16:15,784
so I kick him out.

385
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:19,654
"Upon whom can I bestow
my awesome knowledge?"

386
00:16:19,656 --> 00:16:20,489
I ask myself.

387
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:23,425
Then in walks Nuktuk
with a twinkle in his eye,

388
00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:26,895
a gorgeous dame on his
arm, and a song on his lips.

389
00:16:26,897 --> 00:16:29,564
He bursts into a rapturous melody...

390
00:16:29,566 --> 00:16:35,670
♪ Where can I find my teacher? ♪

391
00:16:35,672 --> 00:16:36,571
Oh, come on!

392
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:38,840
I wasn't singing, you were not levitating.

393
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:41,810
And Asami is just a
friend, thank you very much.

394
00:16:41,812 --> 00:16:43,512
If you want to tell my true story,

395
00:16:43,514 --> 00:16:45,514
you should start from when I met Korra.

396
00:16:45,516 --> 00:16:49,551
She came to the bending
arena one fateful night...

397
00:16:49,553 --> 00:16:52,587
This place is even more
amazing than I imagined!

398
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:54,422
Name's Bolin, by the way.

399
00:16:54,424 --> 00:16:55,390
Korra.

400
00:16:55,392 --> 00:16:56,358
Boring!

401
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,859
When does the singing start?

402
00:16:57,861 --> 00:16:59,594
There wasn't any singing.

403
00:16:59,596 --> 00:17:01,830
Boo!

404
00:17:01,832 --> 00:17:03,532
You're onscreen talent, kid.

405
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:05,767
Leave the storytelling to the masters.

406
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:08,603
So the trouble begins when the Avatar

407
00:17:08,605 --> 00:17:10,772
is trapped in the spirit world.

408
00:17:10,774 --> 00:17:12,974
The world's most evil villains realize

409
00:17:12,976 --> 00:17:14,176
that with Korra out of the way,

410
00:17:14,178 --> 00:17:17,345
the time is right to try to take out Bolin.

411
00:17:17,347 --> 00:17:19,481
So the worst of the worst team up.

412
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:23,785
They're led by Zaheer...
leader of red lotus

413
00:17:23,787 --> 00:17:24,986
and master of the skies!

414
00:17:24,988 --> 00:17:27,722
A flying chaotic chaos machine!

415
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:29,024
He's joined by Vaatu...

416
00:17:29,026 --> 00:17:32,460
the ultimate force of pure
spirit evil in the universe!

417
00:17:32,462 --> 00:17:36,031
The biggest, meanest,
scariest kite that ever flew!

418
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:38,533
Wait, Zaheer didn't team up with Vaatu.

419
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:39,801
How would that even happen?

420
00:17:39,803 --> 00:17:40,969
How do you think?

421
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:43,972
Hello?

422
00:17:43,974 --> 00:17:45,574
Hey, it's Zaheer.

423
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:46,975
Oh, hey, Zaheer.

424
00:17:46,977 --> 00:17:49,578
Glad I caught you at home.

425
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,379
Uh-huh. Very funny.

426
00:17:51,381 --> 00:17:53,515
Like I can leave this stupid tree.

427
00:17:53,517 --> 00:17:56,384
Hold on. Let me conference in...

428
00:17:56,386 --> 00:17:56,885
Amon!

429
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:58,186
The reanimated zombie body

430
00:17:58,188 --> 00:18:00,922
of the bloodbending
leader of the Equalists!

431
00:18:00,924 --> 00:18:03,792
Hey, guys, I'm totally
in for taking out Bolin.

432
00:18:03,794 --> 00:18:05,994
He's way too powerful and awesome.

433
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:08,029
But can we please not include...

434
00:18:08,031 --> 00:18:10,065
not include who, Amon?

435
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:10,899
The evil Unalaq,

436
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:14,569
the diabolical but incredibly
boring and unpopular sorcerer

437
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:17,739
from the north, who's
listening in on the other line!

438
00:18:17,741 --> 00:18:20,742
I've spent my life trying to defeat Nuktuk,

439
00:18:20,744 --> 00:18:21,710
I mean, Bolin,

440
00:18:21,712 --> 00:18:24,012
and I know just where to find him...

441
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:26,448
with all the beautiful ladies.

442
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,782
Yes, Bolin had a reputation

443
00:18:27,784 --> 00:18:30,252
as the world's greatest ladies' man.

444
00:18:30,254 --> 00:18:33,054
Ooh, now the story's getting interesting.

445
00:18:33,056 --> 00:18:36,458
After leaving the beautiful
but emotionally unstable

446
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,027
water tribe princess at the altar,

447
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:40,662
he met a fetching airbender,

448
00:18:40,664 --> 00:18:44,733
the heir to a vast earth kingdom fortune.

449
00:18:44,735 --> 00:18:47,769
Opal, so smart and caring.

450
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:49,104
So pretty to smell...

451
00:18:49,106 --> 00:18:52,440
And she'll probably never talk to me again

452
00:18:52,442 --> 00:18:54,576
because I'm so stupid!

453
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:55,477
Stupid!

454
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:58,546
So, so, so stupid!

455
00:18:58,548 --> 00:19:00,515
Pull it together, you leaky lug.

456
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:04,552
But the darkest moment is
always right before the dawn.

457
00:19:04,554 --> 00:19:05,487
For at his lowest point,

458
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:09,190
Bolin sought advice from
the man who started it all,

459
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:11,660
the wisest of the wise... me!

460
00:19:11,662 --> 00:19:14,796
For some of my signature sage advice!

461
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:16,131
Nuktuk, I mean, Bolin,

462
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:17,999
there's only one thing for you to do

463
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:19,100
if you want to save the Avatar

464
00:19:19,102 --> 00:19:20,669
and defeat the fearsome foursome.

465
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:22,003
I'm not really sure if I like "fearsome."

466
00:19:22,005 --> 00:19:24,005
I mean, evil squared might be better.

467
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:24,739
Whatever.

468
00:19:24,741 --> 00:19:27,709
You have to assemble the
fightingest airbender army

469
00:19:27,711 --> 00:19:28,543
of all time!

470
00:19:28,545 --> 00:19:30,211
But it turns out the airbender
recruits are a sorry lot,

471
00:19:30,213 --> 00:19:33,281
so Bolin brings them to a secret
mountaintop training facility

472
00:19:33,283 --> 00:19:36,151
where he teaches them the
ancient art of dodging fruit

473
00:19:36,153 --> 00:19:37,953
and balancing on sticks!

474
00:19:37,955 --> 00:19:39,587
Meanwhile, back with zombie Amon...

475
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:42,223
Okay, guys, I think we finally ditched him.

476
00:19:42,225 --> 00:19:43,792
Ha ha. Very funny.

477
00:19:43,794 --> 00:19:44,693
I'm still on the line.

478
00:19:44,695 --> 00:19:48,964
So about that evil plan
to destroy Nuktuk...

479
00:19:48,966 --> 00:19:51,633
Hello? Anyone there?

480
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:53,635
Guys!

481
00:19:53,637 --> 00:19:55,870
And with danger closing in, Opal realizes

482
00:19:55,872 --> 00:19:58,006
how much she loves Bolin and forgives him

483
00:19:58,008 --> 00:20:00,208
for whatever stuff he
was talking about earlier

484
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,577
which will probably not be in the final cut

485
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:04,045
of the mover anyway.

486
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:05,113
She does?

487
00:20:05,115 --> 00:20:06,915
Aww.

488
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:08,616
And she kisses Bolin,

489
00:20:08,618 --> 00:20:12,220
magically passing on the
airbender power of flight!

490
00:20:12,222 --> 00:20:15,557
Okay, that part seems
a little unbelievable.

491
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:16,992
This is no time for thinking, kid.

492
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:19,060
We're heading into the big finale!

493
00:20:19,062 --> 00:20:20,829
Bolin gathers his airbender army

494
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:23,164
to fight alongside Rotan and Juji

495
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,733
against the Terror Square!

496
00:20:24,735 --> 00:20:26,234
Maybe that's the name of the bad guys...

497
00:20:26,236 --> 00:20:28,636
Terror Square. What
about legion of darkness?

498
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:29,904
Well, we'll put a focus group on it.

499
00:20:29,906 --> 00:20:34,209
Bolin teaches the airbenders
to create a giant tornado.

500
00:20:34,211 --> 00:20:36,211
Then he flies around in the sky,

501
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:37,612
pushes Zaheer into it,

502
00:20:37,614 --> 00:20:40,281
turning him into wind forever!

503
00:20:40,283 --> 00:20:43,518
But Bolin doesn't realize that
the universal interplanetary

504
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,522
combination zero hour...
talk about a ticking clock...

505
00:20:47,524 --> 00:20:48,524
is almost upon him!

506
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:51,726
And when Juji shoots his
laser eyes at the evil Unalaq,

507
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:56,231
the beams accidentally fly
into the magic spirit doorway!

508
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:58,700
They bounce off Vaatu, setting him free,

509
00:20:58,702 --> 00:21:01,936
and hit Bolin, turning him into a giant!

510
00:21:01,938 --> 00:21:04,672
But when Vaatu is set
free, the evil Unalaq,

511
00:21:04,674 --> 00:21:07,142
who has always been an
annoyingly clingy person,

512
00:21:07,144 --> 00:21:10,011
is so close to Vaatu that they combine

513
00:21:10,013 --> 00:21:12,414
into one horrifying monster!

514
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:15,683
Giant Bolin and the evil Unavaatu fight

515
00:21:15,685 --> 00:21:18,353
toe-to-toe, zapping each
other with their laser beams

516
00:21:18,355 --> 00:21:20,722
as they stomp around Republic City.

517
00:21:20,724 --> 00:21:23,825
It looks like the evil Unavaatu might win,

518
00:21:23,827 --> 00:21:27,062
but thankfully, Bolin's spiritual mojo

519
00:21:27,064 --> 00:21:32,233
is so strong that he attracts
the queen of the fairies!

520
00:21:32,235 --> 00:21:37,072
With her help, Bolin turns
Unavaatu into magic dust

521
00:21:37,074 --> 00:21:39,240
and sprays him into the sky.

522
00:21:39,242 --> 00:21:42,677
And that's where the stars come from.

523
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:43,945
Oh, yeah, and he turns into a dragon,

524
00:21:43,947 --> 00:21:47,549
and he goes into the spirit
world and saves the Avatar.

525
00:21:47,551 --> 00:21:49,717
The end!

526
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:56,091
Wait. You like that?

527
00:21:56,093 --> 00:21:57,192
It didn't make any sense!

528
00:21:57,194 --> 00:21:59,761
What about zombie Amon?
What happened to him, huh?

529
00:21:59,763 --> 00:22:03,765
And-and-and-and stars
are magic fairy dust?

530
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:06,434
Are you guys crazy? Are you crazy?

531
00:22:06,436 --> 00:22:09,104
It's just a mover. Don't overthink it.

532
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:10,238
It's like a ride.

533
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,639
Never let the truth

534
00:22:11,641 --> 00:22:15,276
get in the way of a good story, kid.

535
00:22:15,556 --> 00:22:20,643
