1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,840
- Земля.

2
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:11,375
Огонь.

3
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:13,143
Воздух.

4
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:14,445
Вода.

5
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:18,682
Только аватар может овладеть всеми 4-мя стихиями

6
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:21,886
и поддерживать гармонию в этом мире.

7
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:28,425
- Спустя 3 года, Кувира объединила

8
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:29,660
регионы бывшего Царства земли

9
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:31,896
под своим новым флагом Империи земли.

10
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:33,998
Но остаётся последний оплот: Заофу.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,999
Тем временем,

12
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,001
Асами восстановила компанию отца

13
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,069
И помогла перепроектировать инфрастуктуру города.

14
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:41,572
А совсем недавно, юные маги воздуха нашли Аватара.

15
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:44,542
Корра избавилась от остатков яда в своём теле

16
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,878
и готова снова вернуться к своим обязанностям.

17
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:11,869
- У нас чрезвычайная ситуация.

18
00:01:15,607 --> 00:01:17,274
- Я свяжусь с президентом Райко.

19
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:20,411
Он пришлёт объединенные силы.

20
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:24,582
- Зовите кого угодно, но никто не придёт вовремя

21
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:29,553
Кувира уже у ворот со всей своей армией.

22
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:41,031
-Завтра, в это же время,

23
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,433
Моя мать подпишет наш договор,

24
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,336
И Империя земли наконец будет едина.

25
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,570
- 7 раз отмерь, 1 раз отрежь.

26
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:50,507
Захват твоего родного города будет совсем другим.

27
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:54,211
- Заофу уже давно мне не родной город.

28
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:56,547
Я готов взять его силой.

29
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:57,281
- Нет.

30
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,450
Весь мир сейчас следит за нами.

31
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,518
Мы должны сделать всё правильно.

32
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,620
Вот зачем нам нужен Болин.

33
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,123
- Ты действительно думаешь, что на него можно положиться?

34
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,558
- Су ему доверяет.

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,393
Она послушается его.

36
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:12,630
- Ты уверена, что нам надо в Заофу?

37
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,399
Папа хотел, чтобы мы отвезли тебя обратно в Республиканский город.

38
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,135
- Если Кувира направляется в Заофу, то и я тоже.

39
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:20,938
Она должна узнать, что Аватар вернулся.

40
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,373
Весь мир должен узнать.

41
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,008
- Ву-ху!

42
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,309
Драка с Аватаром!

43
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,178
Это будет потрясающе!

44
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,614
- Мило, не будет никакой драки.

45
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:32,049
Кувира спасла моего папу.

46
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,250
Она была капитаном стражи Су.

47
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:35,352
Думаю, с ней можно договориться.

48
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:37,087
- Что? Драки не будет?

49
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:40,190
И зачем нам надо было париться и спасать тебя,

50
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:44,395
если ты даже не собираешься никого побить?

51
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:49,633
- Жюли, эта штука включилась?

52
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:50,834
- Запись пошла, сэр.

53
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:54,138
- Привет, я Варрик из международной компании "Варрик"

54
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,442
И это - эксперимент с лозой духов 3-02

55
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,577
Подай мне эту штуковину.

56
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:08,118
В этой стазисной капсуле находится образец лозы духов,

57
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,289
весящий примерно два Жюли.

58
00:03:12,624 --> 00:03:15,759
Я выдвинул постулат о том, что эти лозы духов -

59
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:18,429
это форма чистой энергии, нестабильной

60
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:21,231
в так называемых "нормальных земных условиях".

61
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:24,301
Эта машина должна зарядить батарею с помощью энергии лозы,

62
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:27,304
используя электрический ток,

63
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:28,572
противоположную магнитную полярность

64
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:35,112
и малоизвестное явление, которое я называю Варри-эффектом.

65
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:38,315
Оно работает.

66
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:41,552
Счётчки показывает мощность в 5 Варриков...

67
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:46,190
Уже 7 Варриков.

68
00:03:46,858 --> 00:03:50,227
Эй, что такое?

69
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:53,197
Что происходит?

70
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,234
- Жюли, вырубай его.

71
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:59,703
Слишком много Варриков.

72
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,487
- Сэр...

73
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:19,523
- Ты слишком тяжелая.

74
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:23,193
Могла бы сбросить пару Жюли, знаешь ли.

75
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:25,229
- Думаю, Вы просто слабы, сэр.

76
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,764
Тяните сильнее.

77
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:37,207
- Варрик, ты спас меня.

78
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:38,642
- Конечно, я тебя спас.

79
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:42,146
Я не могу убрать здесь всё самостоятельно.

80
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:42,846
Хватай метлу.

81
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:44,815
- Что случилось?
Нас атаковали?

82
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:48,519
- Да, это была лоза духов, но не волнуйтесь. 

83
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,421
Я ставлю точку в этом проекте.

84
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:52,256
- Как бы не так.

85
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,459
Ты вообще понимаешь, что мы можем сделать с такой силой?

86
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,460
- Да, ещё как.

87
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,362
Именно поэтому нам надо положить этому конец.

88
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,097
Что если это попадёт в злые руки?

89
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,399
- Когда это тебя беспокоило?

90
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:03,801
- Знаю. Не похоже на меня, не так ли?

91
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,202
Обычно, я смотрю на подобный проект,

92
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:08,772
и всё о чём я думаю: "Вау, я смогу нажить на этом целое состояние."

93
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:13,811
Но недавно, я начал в чём-то сомневаться.

94
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,914
Будто я... беспокоюсь за других.

95
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,316
А голос в моей голове постоянно ноет

96
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:22,519
и говорит мне, что хорошо, а что плохо.

97
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:25,422
- Я считаю, что это - голос вашей совести. сэр.

98
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:26,924
- Ну а я - другой голос в твоей голове,

99
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:30,761
и я говорю тебе продолжить этот проект.

100
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:31,562
- Простите, нет.

101
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,865
Я должен настоять на своём.

102
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,768
- Теперь голос в моей голове говорит мне

103
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,469
сбросить тебя на рельсы.

104
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:41,705
Стоит ли его послушаться?

105
00:05:41,707 --> 00:05:42,573
- Нет, нет.

106
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,442
Голоса в голове лживы. Да что они вообще знают?

107
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:46,743
Я буду работать над проектом.

108
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:49,346
Пожалуйста, не бросайте меня.

109
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:08,432
- Асами, ты пришла.

110
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:14,404
- Я здесь, чтобы вернуть это.

111
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:16,206
- Ты их даже не открыла.

112
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,274
- Прекрати писать мне.

113
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:21,411
Я больше не хочу ни видеть, ни слышать тебя.

114
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:22,779
- Прошу тебя, дай мне сказать одну вещь,

115
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:25,849
и потом я не буду тебя беспокоить.

116
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:30,287
Я не могу себя простить за все свои ужасные поступки,

117
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,256
и я не жду твоего прощения.

118
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:36,360
Я разорвал нашу семью на части и разрушил нашу репутацию.

119
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,394
Но в моей плачевной жизни,

120
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:43,200
ты - единственное, что заставляет меня улыбнуться.

121
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:47,437
Я просто хочу, чтобы ты знала. Я очень горжусь тобой, Асами.

122
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:53,143
Ты - лучшее, что я когда-либо создал.

123
00:07:03,421 --> 00:07:04,821
- У меня неприятности?

124
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:07,624
- Нет. Вообще-то, у меня хорошие новости.

125
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:10,827
We want you to be part
of our inner circle.

126
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:12,863
- Inner circle! No way! Yes!

127
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:16,566
Ahem,
that is a great honor.

128
00:07:16,568 --> 00:07:17,701
What does it mean,
exactly?

129
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,603
- It means you've proven
your worth.

130
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,672
We're so close to uniting
the empire,

131
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,708
But su has some resentment
towards me and baatar

132
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,009
That might cloud her judgment

133
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:28,779
And stop her from making
a wise decision.

134
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,448
We believe you can help her
see clearly.

135
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,549
- I can do that.

136
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:33,884
By the time I'm finished
telling her

137
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,820
All the great things we've done,
she'll be begging to join.

138
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:39,389
- Good,
because we're here.

139
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:43,860
- Aren't all these troops
gonna send the wrong message?

140
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:46,096
- The army is here
to project strength.

141
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,499
You're here to present peace.

142
00:07:59,944 --> 00:08:01,712
- Opal,
you're here too.

143
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,181
- No,
you've chosen your side.

144
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,550
- Sides?
There shouldn't be sides.

145
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:09,586
I know, why don't we all stand
in a circle, huh,

146
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:10,620
Maybe hold hands?

147
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:11,755
- I'm not giving up zaofu.

148
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,124
I don't care if you brought
your entire army.

149
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,827
- Su, I didn't bring my army
to threaten you.

150
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,029
I wanted to show you
all that your son and I

151
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,063
Have accomplished.

152
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:21,565
- You must realize
what you're doing

153
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:25,302
Goes against everything your
father and I tried to teach you.

154
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,804
- Son, you belong here.

155
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:28,438
- Why?

156
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,108
So that I can go on living
in your shadow?

157
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,509
- Don't say that.

158
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,711
Can't you see
she's brainwashed you.

159
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:37,514
- Ha,
I didn't brainwash him.

160
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:38,548
I set him free.

161
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,050
And now he's accomplished
more with me

162
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,518
Than he ever could have
with you.

163
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,756
- Okay, guys, obviously,
there's a lot of personal,

164
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:46,723
Painful history here.

165
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:49,693
So what do say we just all
forget about that stuff, huh?

166
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,061
I mean,
that's the past.

167
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,496
Right, wing?
Right, wei?

168
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,698
You guys know
what I'm talking about.

169
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,267
High five.

170
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:58,969
All right.
No, it's cool.

171
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,804
You know what I think
we need to do?

172
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:01,972
Focus on the future.

173
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,007
And the future is bright.
Let me tell you.

174
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:06,676
I've seen it.
Yeah, saw it last month.

175
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:08,845
We went to this town
that had nothing.

176
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:11,048
Most of the people there
had never even seen

177
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,449
A satomobile before.

178
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,685
But now they have
two satomobiles,

179
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,554
Running water,
and a magnet train

180
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:19,089
That goes right through
their town.

181
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,791
I mean,
how awesome is that?

182
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,193
- They might have been happy
when you first arrived,

183
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,028
But I've seen what happens
after you leave.

184
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,864
Citizens are forced to work
as slave labor.

185
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:30,500
Dissenters are sent off
to who knows where.

186
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:31,635
- You're wrong, opal.

187
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,503
Now, I don't know
what you think you've seen,

188
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:35,839
But I'm giving you
the 100% bolin guarantee

189
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,507
That we're making
the earth empire

190
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:38,608
A better place to live.

191
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,645
- I can't believe
you brought bolin here

192
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,647
To try to sway us.

193
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,147
Leave.

194
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:46,950
Zaofu will never accept you
as their leader.

195
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:48,485
- Then you leave me no choice.

196
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:51,955
You have 24 hours to agree
to join the empire,

197
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:55,525
Or we take the city by force.

198
00:10:01,866 --> 00:10:04,534
- I see it.
Zaofu.

199
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:05,936
We made it.

200
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:11,575
And a bunch of other people
are here too.

201
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,609
- Oh, no.

202
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:15,045
I hope we're not too late.

203
00:10:17,915 --> 00:10:18,682
- Korra?

204
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,084
I can't believe it.
Where have you been?

205
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:23,553
You disappeared.
Everyone was so worried.

206
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:25,255
, I'll tell you the whole story
later.

207
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,625
Right now,
I want to help you stop kuvira.

208
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:30,894
What can I do?

209
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,062
- You were just bluffing, right?

210
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,031
I mean, you're not really
going to attack zaofu...Are you?

211
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:38,268
- When people don't cooperate,
we must find other ways

212
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,070
Of convincing them to join.

213
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,271
- Other ways?

214
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,207
How many times have we used
these other ways

215
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:45,041
In the past?

216
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:46,910
- It's not for you
to worry about.

217
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,045
- So...
What does happen

218
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:51,948
To all of those towns
and villages after we leave?

219
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,951
I just realized
I've never really gone back

220
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:55,986
And checked on them.

221
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,921
- Those people
are my loyal subjects,

222
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:01,124
And they contribute
to the empire however I see fit.

223
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:02,759
Now that you're in
the inner circle,

224
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:05,095
You're going to have to accept
some hard truths.

225
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:08,999
- Maybe I'm not really
an inner-circle kind of guy.

226
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,868
Or--or maybe
we don't take over zaofu.

227
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,503
We could just let them be
on their own,

228
00:11:13,505 --> 00:11:15,272
Then yay,
the empire's united.

229
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,773
Congratulations to us.

230
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:19,042
- I didn't know
your personal feelings for opal

231
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:21,811
Were stronger than
your loyalty to me.

232
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:23,780
Zaofu will join us.

233
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:25,682
The only thing
I'm second-guessing

234
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,250
Is the decision
to bring you along.

235
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:31,221
Maybe you need to spend
some time in a reeducation camp.

236
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,790
- I thought that's where
we send people

237
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,825
To learn new trade skills.

238
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:37,694
- Hard truths, bolin.

239
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,497
- Your loyalty
seems to be wavering.

240
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:44,334
- No, no,
I'm totally on your side,

241
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:48,538
Completely 100% loyal.

242
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:54,945
- How did things get so bad
between you and kuvira?

243
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,713
I thought she was your protege?

244
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,248
- She was more than that.

245
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,749
She was like a daughter to me.

246
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:02,185
I took her in
when she was eight years old

247
00:12:02,187 --> 00:12:03,420
And nourished her talents.

248
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,289
Kuvira was smart,
a natural leader,

249
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,858
And quickly rose
through the ranks.

250
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,994
I saw myself in her.

251
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,128
- What happened?

252
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,699
- Three years ago, after
the fall of the earth queen,

253
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:19,102
Raiko and tenzin
came to see me.

254
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:20,270
- The earth kingdom is in chaos.

255
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,906
There's a vacuum of power,
and I'm concerned about

256
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,809
What will happen
if someone doesn't take control

257
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:26,643
Of the situation.

258
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,178
- And do you think I should be
the one?

259
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,447
- You're the perfect person
to take charge.

260
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,083
The world leaders trust you,
and as a beifong,

261
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,085
You have credibility
in the earth kingdom.

262
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,786
- I'm honored
that you thought of me,

263
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:39,823
But I'm not interested
in imposing my ideals

264
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,491
On an entire nation.

265
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:43,260
I'm afraid I can't help you.

266
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,862
- Suyin,
I know this isn't my place,

267
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:47,364
But I think you should do this.

268
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,766
Zaofu has always been a beacon
of modern progress,

269
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,269
And now you can share that
with everyone.

270
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,903
- What would you have me do,

271
00:12:53,905 --> 00:12:56,206
March into ba sing
se with an army?

272
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,674
We'd be seen as conquerors

273
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,743
And greeted with nothing
but war.

274
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:00,910
- There are already wars.

275
00:13:00,912 --> 00:13:03,313
The earth queen nearly destroyed
our nation.

276
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:06,349
This is our opportunity
to change things.

277
00:13:06,351 --> 00:13:09,653
- It's not going to happen.

278
00:13:10,054 --> 00:13:11,755
I didn't realize at the time,

279
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:16,760
But that moment created a rift
between us.

280
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,129
Kuvira turned my own son
against me.

281
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:23,033
And together they plotted
behind my back.

282
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,668
What do you think you're doing?

283
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,170
- We're doing what you
don't have the guts to do.

284
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:30,006
We're going to ba sing se
to help bring order back

285
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:31,074
To the earth kingdom.

286
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,410
- No.
You will stay here.

287
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,245
- And who's going to stop me?

288
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,914
Your security force
was more than happy

289
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:38,715
To join my cause.

290
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,850
They're some of
the best fighters in the world,

291
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:42,385
And they are tired
of being treated

292
00:13:42,387 --> 00:13:43,987
Like exotic birds in your cage.

293
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,424
- If you leave now,
you will never be welcomed back.

294
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:51,494
- When I choose to return,
it will be on my own terms.

295
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:54,798
- Kuvira and baatar left
that day with varrick,

296
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,401
My security force, and a few
of zaofu's wealthiest citizens.

297
00:13:58,403 --> 00:14:02,439
After kuvira proved herself
by stabilizing ba sing se,

298
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,507
Raiko and the other world
leaders made her

299
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:07,410
The provisional head
of the earth kingdom.

300
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:09,379
Once she refused to step down,

301
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,147
I knew it was only
a matter of time

302
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:13,283
Until she made her way
back here.

303
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,385
- I want to fix this.
- You can.

304
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,788
Go into the avatar state
and demolish her army.

305
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,758
Remove kuvira from power
once and for all.

306
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,227
- Fighting is something
the old me would do,

307
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:27,130
But that always
made things worse.

308
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,965
Let me talk with kuvira.

309
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:30,467
Maybe I can reason with her.

310
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:34,371
- Kuvira doesn't listen
to reason.

311
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:52,889
- I can't believe kuvira
locked me in here

312
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:54,023
Like a prisoner.

313
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:55,125
I'm not feeling well.

314
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,860
I think I'm running out of air.

315
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,361
Zhu li,
hold your breath.

316
00:14:58,363 --> 00:14:59,562
- I'm not holding my breath.

317
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:02,499
- Great.
Now we're both gonna die.

318
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,200
- Varrick.

319
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:04,868
Varrick.

320
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,338
- Augh,
and the head voices are back.

321
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:10,540
Bolin,
thank goodness you're here.

322
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,076
Where did that hatch come from?
Forget the hatch.

323
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,311
There's something important
I've got to tell you.

324
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:17,180
- Well,
there's something important

325
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,149
I've got tell you too.

326
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,217
Both:
Kuvira's crazy.

327
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:22,118
- How'd you find out?

328
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,387
- When I refused to build her
a super weapon,

329
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:25,422
She threatened my life.

330
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,824
- She threatened me too,
and she's threatening zaofu.

331
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,959
And it turns out
she's been threatening villages

332
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:30,960
This whole time.

333
00:15:30,962 --> 00:15:32,295
We've got to get out of here.

334
00:15:32,297 --> 00:15:35,932
- I couldn't agree more, kid.

335
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:46,810
- We have an unexpected guest.

336
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:50,280
The avatar is here to see you.

337
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:54,884
- Korra, it's such an honor
to see you again.

338
00:15:54,886 --> 00:15:58,087
The last I heard, you were
still healing in the south pole.

339
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:00,924
- Well,
I'm feeling much better now.

340
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,192
- That's wonderful news.

341
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,494
- I'm here to ask you
to back down.

342
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,563
Please,
take your army and leave.

343
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:11,901
- I think we both know
that's not going to happen.

344
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:19,943
- I can't let you take zaofu.

345
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,612
- Look, I was tasked
with bringing stability

346
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,113
To the earth kingdom.

347
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:26,049
Zaofu is the last holdout.

348
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,584
Why should I treat it
differently

349
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,818
Than any other state?

350
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,353
- What you're doing isn't right.

351
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:33,256
- I understand you're just
trying to do su a favor,

352
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,625
But you can't come to me
as I'm on the verge

353
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:38,294
Of reuniting my nation
and tell me to stop.

354
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:41,598
The world was descending
into chaos while you were gone.

355
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,435
In order to fix it, I had
to make some tough decisions.

356
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,870
- I know what that's like.

357
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,605
I've had plenty of people
mad at me

358
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,273
About decisions I've made.

359
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:51,140
- Exactly.

360
00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:53,142
Korra,
if you really want to help,

361
00:16:53,144 --> 00:16:57,080
Go back to su and try to talk
some sense into her.

362
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,815
Let's call a temporary truce.

363
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,718
I won't make any moves
until you talk to her

364
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,785
And get back to me.

365
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:06,422
- Maybe that will be
for the best.

366
00:17:06,424 --> 00:17:07,590
- Have you seen bolin?

367
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:11,728
- He came by to see varrick,
but we turned him away.

368
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,063
- Open the door.

369
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:19,903
We have some fugitives to catch.

370
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:25,041
- Okay, I say we go up
and around the mountains

371
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:26,743
And sneak into zaofu
from the rear.

372
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,278
- We're not going to zaofu.

373
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,412
That place is doomed.

374
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:30,680
We've got to head
to republic city.

375
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:33,283
- What? No. No, no, no.
We've got to help here.

376
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,518
- We'll be helping
by warning the world

377
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,321
About kuvira's potential
super weapon.

378
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,422
- Well,
that is helping,

379
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:41,758
But it's a completely
different type of helping.

380
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,093
Hmm, let me think about this.

381
00:17:44,095 --> 00:17:46,095
Ahh!

382
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:47,764
- Argh!

383
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,566
- Ahh!

384
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:53,403
- Argh!

385
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,172
Ahh! Ahh!

386
00:17:59,877 --> 00:18:01,611
That's not the flamethrower.

387
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,380
What idiot designed
these things?

388
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:05,315
- You did, sir.

389
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,318
- Less lecturing,
more saving my life.

390
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,119
- Ugh!

391
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:12,455
Ahh!

392
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:14,724
Argh!

393
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,292
- Oh!

394
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:18,027
- Argh!

395
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:21,097
- Ahh!

396
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,632
Ugh.

397
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:27,804
Ahh!

398
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:32,108
Argh!

399
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:40,817
Argh!

400
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,653
- Hey,
I think I figured it out.

401
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:46,823
- Ahh!

402
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,426
Sir, you're making this
very difficult.

403
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:52,261
Ahh!

404
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:55,531
- Argh!

405
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:57,400
Yah!

406
00:18:59,536 --> 00:19:02,138
- Augh!

407
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,408
- Ahh!

408
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,646
- Argh!

409
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:16,352
Argh!

410
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:17,754
- Augh!

411
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,323
Ahh!

412
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:25,395
- Ahh!

413
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,330
Ahh-ahh!

414
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:37,306
Argh!

415
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:38,508
- Stop.

416
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,344
Turn yourself over or else.

417
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,347
- Thanks a lot, zhu li.

418
00:19:51,422 --> 00:19:53,489
- You came back.

419
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:54,390
- When I first came here,

420
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:56,659
It was because I wanted
to tell you face-to-face

421
00:19:56,661 --> 00:20:00,430
That I never wanted to see
or hear from you again.

422
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,265
I wanted my words to hurt you,

423
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:05,435
So that you would know
how you hurt me.

424
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,235
- I'm sorry.

425
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:10,339
- But when I saw you,
it wasn't anger I felt.

426
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:11,674
It was sadness.

427
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:15,878
You tainted our past and
destroyed our future together.

428
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,946
- I want to make amends.

429
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:20,817
- I'm not sure I'll ever be able
to forgive you,

430
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:24,887
But that doesn't mean
I shouldn't try.

431
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:28,591
I thought we could play
some pai sho,

432
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:30,727
Like we used to.

433
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,130
- Nothing would make me happier.

434
00:20:40,704 --> 00:20:42,572
[together]
augh!

435
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:46,442
- Don't torture us.

436
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:49,245
- Send these three away
on the next train.

437
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:53,116
Bolin and zhu li will be going
to the reeducation camp

438
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,751
For our most severe dissenters.

439
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:58,621
And you will continue work
on the spirit energy project

440
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:01,390
Under close,
armed supervision.

441
00:21:01,392 --> 00:21:04,627
I want it weaponized
immediately.

442
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:06,462
- Please,
have mercy on me.

443
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:09,732
Don't send me away.
Take me back.

444
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:10,466
- Why would I?

445
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:14,804
- Because my only mistake was
being loyal to the wrong person.

446
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,372
I was blindly devoted
to varrick,

447
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:18,808
And I looked past all the times
he ridiculed me

448
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,945
Or ordered me around or made me
clean his disgusting feet,

449
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:26,015
Because I thought he possessed
the most brilliant mind

450
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:28,885
In the world,
but when I met you,

451
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,453
I realized I was wrong.

452
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,256
Compared to you,
varrick's a fool.

453
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,957
- Hey, come on.
I'm right here.

454
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,926
- I believe in everything
you've done,

455
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,761
And I believe in your vision.

456
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:41,030
I want to devote my life to you.

457
00:21:41,032 --> 00:21:45,935
I pledge my allegiance to you,
great uniter.

458
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,938
- You two could learn something
from her.

459
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,072
Rise, zhu li.

460
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:51,808
I'll give you another chance.

461
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,943
- Think about what you're doing.

462
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,511
We're partners.

463
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:56,379
We have history.

464
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,447
- I did everything
you ever asked of me,

465
00:21:58,449 --> 00:22:00,516
And you never appreciated it.

466
00:22:00,518 --> 00:22:02,518
Guards, do the thing.

467
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,555
- No,
not the thing.

468
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:08,357
Zhu li.

469
00:22:09,426 --> 00:22:11,561
- Where's su?
I have to talk to her.

470
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:12,728
- She's not here.

471
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,863
She took wing and wei.

472
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,199
They're going to sneak into
kuvira's camp

473
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,034
And put an end to this.

474
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,537
- No.
