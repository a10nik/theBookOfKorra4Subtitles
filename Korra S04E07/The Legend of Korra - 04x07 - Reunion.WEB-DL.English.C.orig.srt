1
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:09,473
Earth.

2
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:11,375
Fire.

3
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:13,143
Air.

4
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:14,445
Water.

5
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:18,682
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements

6
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:21,292
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:26,998

8
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:28,889
Kuvira has defeated the Avatar

9
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:31,058
and now controls the entire earth empire.

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,228
Luckily, the airbender
kids and Opal rescued Korra

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,162
and escaped Zaofu.

12
00:00:35,164 --> 00:00:36,797
For the first time in three years,

13
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,265
Korra will finally be
back in Republic City.

14
00:00:38,267 --> 00:00:41,502
Meanwhile, Varrick and
Bolin escaped from Baatar Jr.

15
00:00:41,504 --> 00:00:42,203
And are on the run.

16
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:43,737
But will they make it
back to the city in time

17
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,442
to warn everyone about Kuvira's
new spirit energy super weapon?

18
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:09,630
Naga!

19
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:28,415
I missed you so much, girl.

20
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:31,252
Mom! Dad! We're back!

21
00:01:31,254 --> 00:01:32,254
And we got Korra!

22
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:35,689
Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes.

23
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:37,958
Bum-Ju and I sure missed you.

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,561
It's so great to see you again, Bumi.

25
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:41,929
And you too, Bum-Ju.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,165
Well done, kids.

27
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:47,668
I'm proud of you all for finding Korra.

28
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,338
Proud enough to get me my tats?

29
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,841
No.

30
00:01:53,843 --> 00:01:54,742
Welcome home.

31
00:01:54,744 --> 00:01:56,143
I missed you, Tenzin.

32
00:01:56,145 --> 00:01:58,245
Now, I hate to get right down to business,

33
00:01:58,247 --> 00:02:01,649
but I want to hear what happened in Zaofu.

34
00:02:02,385 --> 00:02:04,051
Way to ruin the moment.

35
00:02:04,053 --> 00:02:05,719
Kuvira's whole army was there.

36
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:08,022
She captured mom, dad, and my brothers.

37
00:02:08,024 --> 00:02:11,091
I thought I was strong enough to stop her.

38
00:02:11,093 --> 00:02:12,426
I feel like such a failure.

39
00:02:12,428 --> 00:02:15,396
No one expected you to
handle Kuvira on your own.

40
00:02:15,398 --> 00:02:20,067
It's up to all of us to
find a way to deal with her.

41
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:22,803
We're just glad to have you back.

42
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:24,004
Where's Bolin?

43
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:26,440
He's not still on Kuvira's side, is he?

44
00:02:26,442 --> 00:02:28,275
I can't believe he would stay with her

45
00:02:28,277 --> 00:02:30,210
after what she did to my family.

46
00:02:30,212 --> 00:02:33,747
But we don't know where he is.

47
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:37,651
How about you use your
own legs for a while?

48
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:40,321
You know, when I fled
Republic City with Zhu Li,

49
00:02:40,323 --> 00:02:43,057
she carried me twenty Miles in one day.

50
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:45,125
And that was after she sprained her ankle.

51
00:02:45,127 --> 00:02:48,128
Well, Zhu Li's not here, okay?

52
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,962
That's fine.

53
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:51,999
Leave me here. Let the worms gobble me up.

54
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:54,101
I deserve it. No way, mister.

55
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:55,402
You're not getting off that easily.

56
00:02:55,404 --> 00:02:58,138
You're responsible for that
weapon Kuvira's trying to make.

57
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,875
Which, may I remind you,
could hurt a lot of people.

58
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:02,877
No, don't remind me!

59
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:05,979
I know, I'm a horrible, horrible person.

60
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:06,847
Okay, look,

61
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:09,083
Kuvira fooled us both
into doing her dirty work

62
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:10,517
and I'm not happy about it either.

63
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:13,654
But you know how we're gonna
make it up to the world?

64
00:03:13,656 --> 00:03:15,055
By getting back to Republic City

65
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:17,358
and warning everyone what she's up to.

66
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,160
So I want you to take my hand,

67
00:03:20,162 --> 00:03:25,032
and march with me out of this forest!

68
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,334
You really have a way with words, kid.

69
00:03:27,336 --> 00:03:29,336
No wonder I made you a mover star.

70
00:03:29,338 --> 00:03:32,139
All right, I'll take the
driver's seat for a while.

71
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:32,973
Hop on.

72
00:03:32,975 --> 00:03:33,874
Great.

73
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:35,476
My feet could use a break.

74
00:03:35,478 --> 00:03:39,179
Okay. Oh, boy.

75
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:41,048
Here we go.

76
00:03:43,886 --> 00:03:46,253
- Ah!
- Oh!

77
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:49,056
Are you kidding me?

78
00:03:51,593 --> 00:03:54,395
I hope you haven't been waiting long.

79
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:57,998
Only three years.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,434
It's so good to see you again.

81
00:04:00,436 --> 00:04:01,502
You too.

82
00:04:01,504 --> 00:04:03,270
And I'm loving the hair.

83
00:04:03,272 --> 00:04:06,039
Thanks. You're looking snazzy as always.

84
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:10,944
Come on, Mako got us a
table at the restaurant.

85
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:11,912
Korra!

86
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:14,148
Hi, Mako.

87
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:17,217
Hello there, Prince Wu,

88
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:19,887
rightful heir to the
throne, and this guy's boss.

89
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:23,123
I bet he's
told you a lot about me.

90
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,158
Nope. Not a thing.

91
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,927
Then we have so much to talk about.

92
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:28,862
You are going to love the food here.

93
00:04:28,864 --> 00:04:29,897
I know the chef personally.

94
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:33,167
Let's start with a round of
your spicy octopus fritters.

95
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:35,569
And keep the cucumber-aloe water flowing.

96
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:39,773
Got to keep this princely skin hydrated.

97
00:04:39,775 --> 00:04:42,576
I thought it was just
going to be the three of us.

98
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:44,978
Sorry, I couldn't ditch him.

99
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,080
But he promised to be on his best behavior.

100
00:04:47,082 --> 00:04:49,383
Hey, pop into the Avatar state for me.

101
00:04:49,385 --> 00:04:51,485
I want to see your eyes glow.

102
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:53,053
What? No.

103
00:04:53,522 --> 00:04:56,423
So can you go into the Avatar state again?

104
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:59,326
I was worried when you
told me you couldn't.

105
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:00,494
Wait.

106
00:05:00,496 --> 00:05:02,796
When did she tell you she couldn't?

107
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:06,500
What's going on with you two?

108
00:05:06,502 --> 00:05:08,502
I wrote to Asami while I was away.

109
00:05:08,504 --> 00:05:11,338
I asked her not to tell you. I'm sorry.

110
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,440
Well, why didn't you ever write to me?

111
00:05:13,442 --> 00:05:14,775
Or Bolin?

112
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:15,509
I don't know.

113
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:18,145
I guess I didn't know what to say.

114
00:05:18,147 --> 00:05:19,413
A "hello" would have been nice.

115
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:21,548
Mako, if it makes you feel any better,

116
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,283
she didn't write me either.

117
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:24,285
Why would she...

118
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:25,519
Never mind.

119
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:28,956
I'm sorry I didn't stay
in touch, but I'm back now.

120
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,157
And I want to know everything

121
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:31,925
about what's been going on with you two.

122
00:05:31,927 --> 00:05:34,127
Well, I kind of have some big news.

123
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:37,464
I went to visit my
father for the first time.

124
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:38,465
He'd been writing me letters

125
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:42,903
and I guess I finally felt
ready to try and forgive him.

126
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:44,404
You sure you can trust him?

127
00:05:44,406 --> 00:05:46,306
He might just be manipulating you again.

128
00:05:46,308 --> 00:05:49,710
You think I don't know what
my own father is capable of?

129
00:05:49,712 --> 00:05:51,011
No. No, I didn't mean...

130
00:05:51,013 --> 00:05:53,013
you don't get to disappear for three years

131
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:55,249
and then act like you
know what's best for me.

132
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:57,084
It's not like I planned
to be gone that long.

133
00:05:57,086 --> 00:06:01,121
I wanted to come back, but
I never felt ready until now.

134
00:06:01,123 --> 00:06:03,490
As much as I'm enjoying
this little catch-up,

135
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:06,927
my royal bladder is about to explode.

136
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:07,394
Mako?

137
00:06:07,396 --> 00:06:09,229
Come on, I need you to stand guard.

138
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:10,330
I'm not gonna hold your hand

139
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:12,432
every time you have to
empty your royal bladder.

140
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:15,068
Go to the bathroom on your own for once.

141
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,171
Fine.

142
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:20,541
Do you always go to the bathroom with him?

143
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:22,009
I don't go "with him" with him.

144
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:25,345
I just stand there in the
general vicinity while he...

145
00:06:25,347 --> 00:06:28,815
I don't want to talk about it.

146
00:06:31,386 --> 00:06:32,352
Good afternoon, sir.

147
00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:35,222
Perhaps a spritz of cologne to freshen up?

148
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:37,424
Make it a double, buddy.

149
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:43,860
Mako, help!

150
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,795
Wu down.

151
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:48,097
Wu... Down.

152
00:06:52,737 --> 00:06:54,304
I wish Pabu were here.

153
00:06:54,306 --> 00:06:55,872
He could just chew us out of this.

154
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:59,709
You know who else has
incisors sharp as a knife?

155
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,078
Zhu Li.

156
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,179
Well, look what we caught.

157
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:07,617
Wonder if they were
tracking us after we escaped.

158
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:08,985
Hello, fellow travelers!

159
00:07:08,987 --> 00:07:11,621
I don't suppose you could
help us out of this net?

160
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:16,859
Why would we free a couple of
lowly earth empire soldiers?

161
00:07:16,861 --> 00:07:17,427
Lowly?

162
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:20,263
We were part of Kuvira's inner circle!

163
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:21,130
Were! Not anymore.

164
00:07:21,132 --> 00:07:23,933
We jumped ship. Please just let us out.

165
00:07:23,935 --> 00:07:25,702
I think I know just what to do

166
00:07:25,704 --> 00:07:29,672
with a couple of Kuvira's top men.

167
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,075
Snap!

168
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,676
Ahh!

169
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:38,348
I wonder what's taking Wu so long.

170
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,950
He's not one to miss out on lunch.

171
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:43,620
I'll go check on him.

172
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:51,928
Wu, you in here?

173
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,831
Come on, your octopus
fritters are getting cold.

174
00:07:58,802 --> 00:08:01,904
I'll be right back.

175
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:07,977
Excuse me, did you happen to see
if Prince Wu came out this way?

176
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,046
Sorry, miss. Haven't seen him.

177
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:14,050
Hmm. I'm in laundry.

178
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:15,052
Ah!

179
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:19,956
They've got Wu!

180
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,959
Get the car, I'm going after them.

181
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:36,330
Get in.

182
00:08:44,673 --> 00:08:47,641
- Ah!
- Ah!

183
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:48,542
We're losing them.

184
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:49,977
Hang a right at the next block.

185
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:53,314
We can cut them off on seventh.

186
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:55,349
You missed the turn! Where are you going?

187
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,384
I know these streets better than you.

188
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:59,587
I built some of them.

189
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:09,430
What are you doing? Sit down.

190
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:18,539
Where is he?

191
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,307
Whoa!

192
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,146
Wu's not here.

193
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,149
This guy was the only one in the truck.

194
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:31,452
Where's the prince?

195
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:34,088
Halfway to Kuvira by now.

196
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:37,157
All hail the Great Uniter.

197
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,693
They must have moved Wu
to a different vehicle

198
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:41,295
when we lost sight of them.

199
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,301
Take this guy in for booking.

200
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:48,369
Charge him with kidnapping.

201
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:51,038
And tell Chief Beifong
that Prince Wu is missing.

202
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,806
Put out an all points bulletin.

203
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:54,475
We'll keep looking.

204
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:55,409
Where do we start?

205
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,711
There are thousands of cars in the city

206
00:09:57,713 --> 00:09:59,213
and he could be in any one of them.

207
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:02,149
Or they might try smuggling
him out on an airship.

208
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:03,350
Or maybe a boat.

209
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,152
He could be anywhere!

210
00:10:05,154 --> 00:10:10,124
The one time I don't watch him
pee and this is what happens.

211
00:10:26,741 --> 00:10:29,243
They're taking Wu to the train station!

212
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:30,844
Are you sure? How do you know?

213
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:33,414
I'll explain on the way, just drive!

214
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,517
We're running out of time!

215
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:43,357
So how did a bunch of
water and fire benders

216
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:46,427
end up in one of Kuvira's
reeducation camps?

217
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:48,696
Call it what it is... a prison.

218
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:50,431
Kuvira's been purging states of anyone

219
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:54,068
who's not of earth kingdom
origin and locking them up.

220
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:54,668
Purging?

221
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,370
What are you acting so surprised for?

222
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:58,272
You must have known what she was up to,

223
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:01,141
being part of her "inner circle" and all.

224
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:01,775
No, I swear.

225
00:11:01,777 --> 00:11:04,745
And the inner circle thing
lasted, like, less than a day.

226
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,415
Will you at least tell
us where you're taking us?

227
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,483
The border checkpoint.

228
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:11,318
You're gonna help us talk our way past

229
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,187
some earth empire soldiers.

230
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:14,221
And once we're through,

231
00:11:14,223 --> 00:11:17,291
we'll see about letting you go.

232
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:25,599
Ha ha!

233
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,402
Lava time! Bet you didn't expect that!

234
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:31,205
Look, I'm sorry for what
happened to all of you,

235
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:33,240
but as I've been trying to explain,

236
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:35,476
we don't work for Kuvira anymore.

237
00:11:35,478 --> 00:11:38,545
Yeah, if our handsome mugs get recognized

238
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:40,581
trying to go through that checkpoint,

239
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:41,415
we're goners!

240
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:44,184
If you really are fugitives,
you better listen up.

241
00:11:44,186 --> 00:11:46,186
We've been scouting this region for days.

242
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:48,722
There's a wall stretching
along the entire border

243
00:11:48,724 --> 00:11:50,624
and patrols guarding every part of it.

244
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,960
That checkpoint is our only way out.

245
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,395
It's not worth the risk, baraz.

246
00:11:55,397 --> 00:11:57,464
How do we know they won't turn us in?

247
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,466
If he wanted us gone,

248
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,601
we'd be at the bottom of
a pool of lava right now.

249
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:03,804
If any of us want to get out
of the earth empire alive,

250
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,341
we'll have to trust each other.

251
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:13,113
All right, where's this checkpoint?

252
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:16,216
So how do you know where Wu is

253
00:12:16,218 --> 00:12:17,484
just by touching some spirit vines?

254
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,721
I learned how to connect to
people's energy through them.

255
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:22,189
Who taught you that?

256
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:23,423
Lin's mom.

257
00:12:23,425 --> 00:12:24,425
I found her in the swamp.

258
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:27,361
That place is like one giant spirit wild.

259
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:28,729
You met Toph?

260
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:29,530
What was she like?

261
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:32,399
A cranky, more miserable version of Lin.

262
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:34,268
Is that even possible?

263
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,570
You'd be surprised.

264
00:12:46,247 --> 00:12:47,781
Which train is Wu on?

265
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:48,682
I don't know!

266
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,718
Split up and start looking.

267
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:02,796
Follow my lead.

268
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:05,666
Good afternoon, sir. Can we help you?

269
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:06,567
You sure can.

270
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:07,801
We captured these escaped prisoners.

271
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:09,603
We need to get them to a secure facility.

272
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:12,406
- Where'd they escape from?
- Camp 14.

273
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:14,675
Then why are you bringing them through here?

274
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:16,009
Camp 14's back the other way.

275
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:19,546
You think we don't know where camp 14 is?

276
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,315
Kuvira wants them transferred.

277
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:24,618
Then I'll need to see the transfer order.

278
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,254
Listen, pal, I had to
fight off 2 badger-moles,

279
00:13:27,256 --> 00:13:29,957
6 wolf-bats, and 18
hog-monkeys to get these guys.

280
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:31,658
So sorry if I don't have the paperwork.

281
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,494
I was too busy cramming
it in a hog-monkey's mouth

282
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:35,796
while it was trying to eat me.

283
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:36,830
I am in sore need of a shower

284
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:39,600
and I have blisters that
are the size of cantaloupes

285
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:40,767
and twice as juicy!

286
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:41,768
So you can let us through,

287
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,303
or you can give me your name and rank

288
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:44,438
and I'll pass it on to Kuvira.

289
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,706
You know what happens to soldiers

290
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,841
who question her orders, don't you?

291
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:50,911
Bad stuff!

292
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,746
Let them through!

293
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:09,630
Wait! Stop them!

294
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:12,532
They're traitors to the empire!

295
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:27,814
There's no way I'm going back to prison!

296
00:14:39,594 --> 00:14:41,762
Ah. Ah! Ah!

297
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:18,298
Ah!

298
00:15:20,568 --> 00:15:22,436
Ah!

299
00:16:11,085 --> 00:16:13,920
Boy, I sure hope this works.

300
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,834
I still got that Varrick touch.

301
00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:34,007
We're clear. Come on!

302
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:38,678
Ah!

303
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,482
Varrick, wait! We can't leave them.

304
00:16:45,586 --> 00:16:47,954
Ah!

305
00:16:50,758 --> 00:16:52,492
Retreat!

306
00:16:58,066 --> 00:17:01,068
Thanks. You didn't have to come back.

307
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,804
Yeah, I kind of did.

308
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:05,806
Let's go.

309
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:08,308
The 4:15 bound for Omashu

310
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,011
is now leaving on track number six.

311
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:13,947
All aboard!

312
00:17:14,248 --> 00:17:19,519
If we don't find Wu soon,
we might never find him.

313
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,562
He's on that train!

314
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:33,233
How do you know for sure he's here?

315
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:35,635
I don't. But I had a feeling, okay?

316
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,105
And I'm just supposed to
trust "Avatar feelings"?

317
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:40,807
You wouldn't have to if
you had guarded the prince

318
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,276
like you were supposed to.

319
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:46,012
Oh, so it's my fault Wu disappeared.

320
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:47,814
It's certainly not mine!

321
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,816
Guys, shh.

322
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:53,186
Listen.

323
00:17:54,756 --> 00:17:56,590
Wu! Wu, it's me.

324
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:58,391
Mako? Where am I?

325
00:17:58,393 --> 00:18:01,895
Am I dead? No, you're on a train.

326
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:04,831
We're gonna get you out of here.

327
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:13,640
- Gah!
- Ah!

328
00:18:17,044 --> 00:18:18,645
Everyone out.

329
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:21,281
I'm not going up there.

330
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:23,984
Ah!

331
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,192
Ah!

332
00:18:43,738 --> 00:18:45,939
Ah!

333
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,017
Jump!

334
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:59,886
- Ah!
- Ah!

335
00:19:07,963 --> 00:19:08,895
- You all right?
- Yes!

336
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,131
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you,

337
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:12,165
thank you, thank you, thank you.

338
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:13,900
You are definitely getting a raise, buddy.

339
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,035
You should be thanking Korra.

340
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:17,237
We never would have found you without her.

341
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,072
I owe you my life, Avatar.

342
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,908
If only there was some way to repay you.

343
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,642
Ooh, I know.

344
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:24,377
How about I take you out
for a night on the town?

345
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:26,880
Really? You're asking me out right now?

346
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:29,716
So... I'll put you down for a "maybe"?

347
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:31,218
How about a never?

348
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,921
Not exactly what I imagined
for our first day back together.

349
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,856
But it was kind of like old times.

350
00:19:36,858 --> 00:19:39,793
Except for the getting on
each other's nerves part.

351
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:43,430
Actually, that is like
old times for me and Korra.

352
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,299
I'm sorry things got so tense earlier.

353
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:47,167
It's all right.

354
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:48,902
I guess after being apart for three years,

355
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:51,104
there's bound to be a bit
of an adjustment period.

356
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,807
Yeah, but it's great to have you back.

357
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:59,079
There's no place else I'd rather be.

358
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:00,146
Mm.

359
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:05,285
You guys are the greatest
friends a guy could have.

360
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,287
So what are we gonna do with him?

361
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,923
It's too dangerous to
take him back to the hotel.

362
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:11,258
Whoo. You're telling me!

363
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,260
I need a cushy safe house somewhere.

364
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:16,630
I think I know just the place.

365
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:19,432
Nice digs, Mako.

366
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:21,568
You didn't tell me you came from money.

367
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,004
I don't. This is Asami's place.

368
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:26,306
She was nice enough to
let my family stay here

369
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,009
after they fled Ba Sing Se.

370
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:29,943
Mako!

371
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:32,012
It's so wonderful to...

372
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:34,748
Are you...

373
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,883
Grandma, this is Prince Wu.

374
00:20:36,885 --> 00:20:39,986
He needs to stay with you and
the family for a little while.

375
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:43,390
It's an honor, grandma Mako.

376
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:46,993
She loves royalty.

377
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,195
I think I'll fit right in here.

378
00:20:49,197 --> 00:20:51,264
Thanks for looking out for me, Mako.

379
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:52,966
Now where's the nearest bathroom?

380
00:20:52,968 --> 00:20:56,336
I have been holding it all day!

381
00:20:57,772 --> 00:20:58,938
I know it might not mean much

382
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,640
coming from a guy wearing this uniform,

383
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:05,979
but I'd like to apologize for
what Kuvira's put you through.

384
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:08,515
I appreciate that.

385
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,950
Guess this is where we part ways.

386
00:21:10,952 --> 00:21:12,886
It's been a blast!

387
00:21:12,888 --> 00:21:14,187
We're heading north too.

388
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,322
Why don't you come with us?

389
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:18,491
It's the least we can do
after you saved our necks.

390
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:21,261
On that hunk of junk? No thanks.

391
00:21:21,263 --> 00:21:22,962
I'm allergic to drowning.

392
00:21:22,964 --> 00:21:23,530
Oof!

393
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:27,167
I mean, uh, we'd love a lift!

394
00:21:30,204 --> 00:21:32,739
Ew. Uh.

395
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,486
This area is overrun with spirit vines

396
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:48,455
and they appear to be even more powerful

397
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:51,358
than the samples we
took from Republic City.

398
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,192
Perfect.

399
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:57,197
Harvest these vines until
there's nothing left.

400
00:22:05,661 --> 00:22:10,704
