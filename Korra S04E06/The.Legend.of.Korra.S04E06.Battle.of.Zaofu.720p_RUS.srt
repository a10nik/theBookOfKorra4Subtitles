1
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:09,473
- Земля.

2
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:11,375
Огонь.

3
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:13,143
Воздух.

4
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:14,445
Вода.

5
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:18,682
Только аватар может овладеть всеми 4-мя стихиями

6
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:22,786
и поддерживать гармонию в этом мире.

7
00:00:26,391 --> 00:00:29,026
- Кувира угрожает взять Заофу силой.

8
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:31,095
Между Су Бейфонг и её бывшей ученицей

9
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:34,031
вспыхнула вражда, и Корра вызвалась заключить перемирие.

10
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:35,032
Но было уже слишком поздно.

11
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,967
Су со воими сыновьями уже были на пути

12
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:38,002
к лагерю Кувиры, чтобы убить её.

13
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,970
В то же время, Болин и Варрик узнали о

14
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:42,506
тиранических намерениях Кувиры и сбежали из её армии.

15
00:00:42,508 --> 00:00:44,375
Но их поймали и теперь держат в неволе,

16
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,478
а Жюли предала Варрика и теперь служит Кувире.

17
00:01:07,432 --> 00:01:08,699
- Ты уверена, что это сработает?

18
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,969
Даже без Кувиры, они способны нас сокрушить.

19
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,537
- БОльшую часть этой армии заставили

20
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:14,605
служить Кувире.

21
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,474
Если мы уберём её с дороги, у них не будет причин сражаться.

22
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:22,580
Сегодня мы положим конец правлению тирана.

23
00:01:56,214 --> 00:01:58,115
Она там одна.

24
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:02,219
Это наш шанс.

25
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:13,330
- Не бейте меня!
- Жюли?

26
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:22,573
- Я знала, что ты попытаешься незаметно напасть.

27
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,975
Ты боялась брать ответственность в управлении Царством земли,

28
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:28,512
когда у тебя был шанс, ты боялась присоединиться ко мне,

29
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:29,780
когда я стала лидером,

30
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:32,449
а сейчас ты боишься честного сражения.

31
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:35,552
Ты всегда была трусом.

32
00:02:35,554 --> 00:02:39,256
Взять их.

33
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:41,592
- Корра, ты должна остановить Су,

34
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,460
пока она не совершит непоправимое.

35
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:45,529
- Остановить её? Да мы должны помогать ей!

36
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:49,433
- Мы понятия не имеем, где сейчас твоя мама, или какой у неё план.

37
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,235
Если мы ворвёмся в лагерь Кувиры,

38
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:54,171
их всех заберут в плен, если не хуже.

39
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,173
Всё, что мы сейчас можем - это ждать.

40
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,076
- Внимание, граждане Заофу.

41
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:02,780
Ваш лидер, Су Бейфонг, попыталась напасть на меня

42
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:06,984
сегодня ночью, пока я спала, игнорируя условия нашего перемирия.

43
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:11,588
К счастью, сейчас она со своей штурмовой группой находится у меня под стражей.

44
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,423
- Нет.

45
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,092
- Тем не менее, будьте уверены, я не буду мстить

46
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,428
мирному населению Заофу,

47
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,697
если ваши оставшиеся представители

48
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,433
встретятся со мной у ворот на рассвете, чтобы предложить

49
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:27,037
полную и безоговорчную капитуляцию.

50
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,838
На этом всё.

51
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,008
- Корра, ты не можешь дать Кувире сойти это с рук.

52
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,310
Мы должны вырвать моих братьев и маму из плена.

53
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:35,112
- Ты дала клятву о поддержании мира

54
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,814
когда стала магом воздуха.

55
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,083
Ты не можешь просто взять и напасть на Кувиру.

56
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,484
- Да плевать мне на эту клятву.

57
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,319
Я должна спасти свою семью.

58
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:43,654
- Нет, Джинора права.

59
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,322
Твоя мама напала на лагерь.

60
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:48,325
Кувира просто защищала себя.

61
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:49,493
- Защищала себя?

62
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,228
Она хотела напасть на наш город!

63
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,630
Не могу поверить, что ты отказываешься сражаться.

64
00:03:53,632 --> 00:03:56,667
- Почему эта дамочка из громкоговорителя глаголит,

65
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,737
когда я пытаюсь уснуть?

66
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,271
- Корра, что же нам делать?

67
00:04:01,273 --> 00:04:03,540
- Я и Джинора пойдём поговорим с Кувирой на рассвете,

68
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:05,375
и, может быть, мы сможем как-нибудь договориться.

69
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:09,680
Обещаю, я сделаю всё, чтобы сохранить мир.

70
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:10,814
- Я пойду с тобой.

71
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:12,349
- Мы тоже пойдём.
- Нет.

72
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:15,552
Папа попросил нас найти Корру, и мы её нашли.

73
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:17,287
А сейчас вам надо держаться в безопасности.

74
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:19,423
- Да ладно тебе, дай нам помочь.

75
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,825
- Я не хочу, чтобы они могли схватить кого-то ещё.

76
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:23,360
Вы можете остаться с Батаром и Хуаном,

77
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:25,095
пока я разбираюсь с Кувирой.

78
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:26,630
Убедитесь, чтобы они вернулись к Тензину,

79
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:29,133
Если что-то пойдёт не так.

80
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:29,833
- Вот, блин.

81
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:33,570
Когда я наконец увижу драку?

82
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:38,308
- Банка для печенья пуста.

83
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,345
Нет горячих полотенец.

84
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,347
Никто не чистит мне уши..

85
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,716
Жюли!

86
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:51,588
Эх, её и впрямь нет.

87
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:56,560
- Вставай и за дело, Варрик. Пора работать.

88
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,595
Мы оборудовали для тебя новую лабораторию.

89
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:01,732
Кувира хочет получить исправное оружие на лозе духов

90
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:02,866
как можно быстрее.

91
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:05,469
- Жюли всегда встречала меня утром

92
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,437
с чашкой горячего чая в руках.

93
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,207
- Ты получишь свой чай, когда начнёшь работать.

94
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,575
- Ну, я, вообще говоря, продуктивен

95
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,609
 только где-то 15 минут в день,

96
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:17,247
Обычно - днём, около 15:45.

97
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:18,715
- Ты будешь работать прямо сейчас.

98
00:05:18,717 --> 00:05:21,852
Я хочу, чтобы ты показал мне, как работает это устройство.

99
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,687
- Что происходит?

100
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,989
- Спи давай. Нам нужен только Варрик.

101
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:29,326
Тебе понадобится энергия, когда ты доберёшься до исправительного лагеря.

102
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:32,429
- I can't be expected
to work without an assistant.

103
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:34,198
Without zhu li,
I'm helpless.

104
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,301
- One of the guards
will be your assistant.

105
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,302
I'll be supervising.

106
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:39,469
- Well, I guess he'll be fine,

107
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:42,472
As long as he doesn't
need his hands afterwards.

108
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:44,708
- What's he talking about, sir?

109
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,810
- The last time we worked
with the spirit vines,

110
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:49,313
It created
an uncontrollable blast

111
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,881
That burned through a wall
and could still be

112
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,749
Blowing up comets in space,
as far as I know.

113
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:56,286
I wouldn't want to assist me
if I were you.

114
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:59,623
- Maybe we should just
let the kid help him out.

115
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,959
- Fine.
Bolin can assist.

116
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,361
- Wait, what? I need my hands!
Uh, hold on.

117
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:10,200
Can we get breakfast first?
While we still have hands?

118
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:22,279
- Release them now!

119
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,716
- If su agrees to bow to me
and turn over zaofu,

120
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,353
She and the rest of your family
will not be harmed.

121
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,922
- Never!
I'll never bow to you!

122
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,791
- There must be some way
for us to resolve this.

123
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:36,627
- I've already laid out
my terms,

124
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,862
And I think
they're very reasonable.

125
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:41,298
After all, su did try
to take me out

126
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,400
During
our peaceful negotiations.

127
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:47,771
- You call bringing an army
to threaten our city peaceful?

128
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:48,605
- Where's bolin?

129
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:50,641
I know he would never
go along with this!

130
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:51,909
- Bolin is with my fiance,

131
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,944
Working on something
very important,

132
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:57,314
But I assure you
he's on board with my plans.

133
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,583
You two have been apart
for some time.

134
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,453
I guess you don't realize
how much bolin has grown up.

135
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:06,390
Now turn over zaofu.

136
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,692
- I can't just let you
take the city.

137
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,528
- Avatar korra,
you are interfering

138
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,897
With internal earth empire
business

139
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:15,832
And letting
your personal feelings

140
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:17,000
Get in the way of reason.

141
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:20,671
Zaofu cannot
continue to rule itself.

142
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,572
They have been hoarding
their riches

143
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:24,007
And technology too long.

144
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:27,277
I'm here to distribute
those resources fairly

145
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,645
Throughout the nation.

146
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:31,014
This is about equality.

147
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:33,383
- You don't care about equality!

148
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:34,785
This is about control!

149
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,752
Just take her down.

150
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:37,521
You know
it's the right thing to do.

151
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,522
You have to stop this!

152
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,525
- The only way you're going
to keep me from marching

153
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,795
Into zaofu
is if you physically stop me.

154
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,396
Now what are you going to do?

155
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:49,967
- It looks like
you're not giving me a choice.

156
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:50,834
- Fine.

157
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:53,704
I want you all to know
that I would never

158
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,105
Ask any of you to do something

159
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,874
That I'm not willing
to do myself.

160
00:07:57,876 --> 00:07:59,910
So rather than risk your lives,

161
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:03,914
I will fight the avatar
one-on-one.

162
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,048
Korra, if you win,

163
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,452
Then you can do
whatever you want with zaofu.

164
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:09,653
But after I beat you,

165
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,089
I want you out of my business
for good.

166
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:16,626
I'm the one who brought peace
to the earth empire, not you.

167
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:18,628
You're not relevant here
anymore.

168
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,831
- Fine.
You want to fight the avatar?

169
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:25,535
Then let's finish this
right here, right now!

170
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:38,482
- Are you really ready
to fight her?

171
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,051
- Just stay back
and let me handle this.

172
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:41,985
It's been a while,

173
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:43,954
But I got
a lot of pent-up rage.

174
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,256
- Don't mess around.
Kuvira is too good.

175
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:49,126
Just go into the avatar state
and get it over with.

176
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:53,797
- No, I'm only going
to use that as a last resort.

177
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,533
- Be careful.

178
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:02,606
- Use whatever you want,
all the elements,

179
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,876
The avatar state,
anything you need.

180
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,678
I know you're a little rusty.

181
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,015
- Хватит болтать.

182
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:30,834
- Looks like the avatar
is a little off her game.

183
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,539
- Don't let her
get you frustrated!

184
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,975
She wants you
to make a mistake!

185
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:21,351
- Болин, сделай это.

186
00:10:21,353 --> 00:10:22,986
- Что "это"?
- Ну ЭТО!

187
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:25,722
Мне никогда не приходилось говорить Жюли, что значит "это"!

188
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:26,723
- А я не Жюли, ясно?

189
00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:27,924
Pretend I don't know anything

190
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:29,226
About anything
that's happening here.

191
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,728
Also pretend I don't want
to build a super weapon

192
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,631
Or get my hands blown off.

193
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:41,972
- Walk me through
what you're doing.

194
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,974
I want to know
every detail of your work.

195
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,675
- You know, when I started
working with the vines,

196
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:48,845
The point was to find a clean,
unlimited source of energy,

197
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:51,548
Not develop
some spirity death ray.

198
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,016
- Clean energy,
sounds great!

199
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:56,119
Who doesn't like that stuff?
Let's do that instead.

200
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:56,820
- Quiet.

201
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,889
You're here to help, not talk.

202
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,224
And you of all people
should realize

203
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:03,226
That once a discovery is made,

204
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:04,895
It is our responsibility
as scientists

205
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:08,865
To pursue it as far as we can,
wherever it leads.

206
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:10,033
- How would you know?

207
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:11,401
You couldn't discover
a wolf-bat

208
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:13,970
If it was building a nest
in your butt.

209
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:16,373
- ooh.

210
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,774
- You're pathetic.

211
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:19,976
Wolf-bats don't build nests.

212
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:22,312
- Ooh, you got me there,
dr. Science.

213
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:26,750
You'll never know how it feels
to give birth to genius,

214
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,853
Only to have it kidnapped
and raised by fools.

215
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,121
- Are you done
with your rambling,

216
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,190
Or do the guards
need to encourage you

217
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,758
To continue your work?

218
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,693
- Okay, okay, okay.

219
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,262
The last time we ran
the current through the vine,

220
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:40,564
We couldn't control the power.

221
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:45,969
So I'm trying something new
to see if I can direct it.

222
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:39,356
- Come on, avatar.

223
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,290
Get up.

224
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,858
Show me what you've got.

225
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,394
- We have to help her.

226
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,664
- No.
Stay back.

227
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:51,268
I can handle this.

228
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,837
- So I see how the current
interacts with the vine,

229
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,006
And here is
a kind of directional tube,

230
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,941
But this baffling
here at the base...

231
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,977
- It looks like that would
only redirect the energy

232
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:02,212
Right back where it came from.

233
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,781
And what's that piece of
equipment you're fiddling with

234
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,149
Now on the power source?

235
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:08,151
- Hand me
the screw-turn-thingy, would ya?

236
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:10,487
- Ugh, I can't believe
you're helping them.

237
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,055
You know this isn't right.

238
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,023
- Funny story, bolin.

239
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,825
I first got the idea
for harnessing spirit power

240
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:18,128
When I watched
that giant unalaq monster

241
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,297
Attack the city
from my jail cell.

242
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,233
That giant monster
set me free.

243
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:27,671
Trust me, kid.
I know what I'm doing.

244
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:32,275
[grunts]
that ought to do it.

245
00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:34,678
Huh.

246
00:13:35,246 --> 00:13:37,981
Okay, stand back.

247
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,149
[device beeping]
there we go.

248
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,950
- What's that ticking?

249
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:42,185
- That's the timer.

250
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:43,753
- The timer for what?

251
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:45,288
- For the bomb, of course!

252
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,256
- What?
What bomb?

253
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,391
- The bomb that's going
to explode in five minutes

254
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:51,294
And destroy this entire train,
all of the spirit vines,

255
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:53,897
And everything else
within a few hundred yards.

256
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,866
You know what, I'd get
out of here if I were you.

257
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:58,902
This is the first time
I've built a timer,

258
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,303
And it might run
a little fast.

259
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:02,372
Bolin and I are ready
to go down with the ship--

260
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,406
Or train in this case--

261
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:06,443
But you seem like
you have a lot to live for.

262
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,344
- No, no, no, no!

263
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,245
I'm not ready to go down
with the ship or the train!

264
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:10,313
- You're bluffing.

265
00:14:10,315 --> 00:14:12,048
- Stick around five minutes,

266
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,883
And you'll find out
who's bluffing.

267
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:16,252
You'll be sorry you left me,
zhu li!

268
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:17,554
When they write
the history books,

269
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:20,123
Your name will be
synonymous with betrayal!

270
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,392
People will say, "hey,
what happened to that guy?"

271
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,526
"oh, didn't you hear,

272
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:26,896
He varrick'd himself
because some girl zhu li'd him!"

273
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:27,997
- Enough.
- [whimpers]

274
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:31,401
- What makes you think
we'd let you blow yourself up?

275
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,203
You're working for kuvira.

276
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,071
You don't get to quit.

277
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:37,340
Grab him.

278
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:40,176
- You try to pull me away
from this thing,

279
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:43,079
And I'll hit this remote
and blow it immediately.

280
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:45,148
- Why do you have
a timer and a remote?

281
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,083
- Well, first I built the timer,
but then I thought

282
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:49,519
You could drag me off the train,
so then I built a remote.

283
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,954
But then I thought,
"well, now,

284
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,255
"do I really need
the timer anymore?

285
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:53,490
Because I got a remote
in my"--

286
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,358
Whatever!
I'm covering all my bases!

287
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,429
The point is, you're leaving.
We're staying.

288
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:14,377
- You have to go
into the avatar state!

289
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:16,880
Do it!

290
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,254
- I don't understand.

291
00:15:58,256 --> 00:15:59,589
We got the poison out.

292
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,425
What's wrong with her?

293
00:16:04,361 --> 00:16:08,331
- I knew you were weak.

294
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:43,166
You broke our agreement!

295
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,367
Attack!

296
00:17:03,387 --> 00:17:08,625
- Keep them back!
I'm calling for help.

297
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:16,466
- Stunning work, ikki.

298
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:21,571
It hurts my eyes
with its raw emotional power.

299
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:29,479
Ah, pedestrian.

300
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,181
I already know what you
look like on the outside.

301
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:36,252
I want you to show me
the inner meelo.

302
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:38,755
- Help!

303
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,490
You have to get korra
and the rest of us

304
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,191
Out of here now!

305
00:17:42,193 --> 00:17:42,759
Hurry!

306
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:46,296
- Finally!
Let's get it on!

307
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:49,632
- This is everyone.
Our half of the train is clear.

308
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:52,435
- That's good.
We're almost out of time.

309
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:53,202
- You're insane.

310
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:55,605
- You knew that
when you hired me.

311
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,674
Bolin, do the thing.

312
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:58,641
- Uh...

313
00:17:58,643 --> 00:17:59,642
- Unhook the cars!

314
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:04,113
Oh, come on,
that was an easy one!

315
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:10,453
- Man, that was great.

316
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:12,355
I gotta admit, you had me
going there for a while.

317
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,691
I really thought
you were going to blow us up.

318
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,426
Now, how do we
turn this thing off?

319
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,662
- Oh, we can't turn it off.
We're going to blow up.

320
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:21,831
But we had a pretty good run,
right?

321
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,399
- What are you talking about,
a good run?

322
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:26,636
I'm still running!
I like running!

323
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:43,453
- I'll see you
on the other side, zhu li.

324
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:47,423
- I want you to know,
I hate you.

325
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,535
- I can't believe
he actually blew himself up.

326
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:04,140
That man was crazier
than a sewer-pipe elephant rat.

327
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:07,343
Let's get back to zaofu.

328
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:13,783
[both coughing]

329
00:19:17,622 --> 00:19:19,522
Yes!
You did it, bolin.

330
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:21,324
You did the thing.

331
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,259
Mwah!

332
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:23,926
- I can't believe

333
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:28,031
Zhu li worked for you
as long as she did.

334
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:48,418
- Dive, pepper!
Dive!

335
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,421
Here comes a hurricane!

336
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:56,659
You can't handle
all this meelo!

337
00:19:56,661 --> 00:20:00,329
- We've got her!
Go!

338
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:03,299
- We have to save them!

339
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:05,268
- Opal, get out of here!

340
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,669
We'll be fine!

341
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:07,370
Just go!

342
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:11,174
- I'll be back for you!
I love you!

343
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:18,448
- Zaofu is ours!

344
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:30,727
- Bring the citizens of zaofu
to kneel

345
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,662
Before the great uniter.

346
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:35,231
All who pledge their loyalty
to me

347
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,533
Will keep their freedom
and be dealt with fairly

348
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:40,737
As full citizens
of the earth empire.

349
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,573
The rest will be imprisoned
as traitors,

350
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:47,343
Like su beifong
and her sons.

351
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:49,779
Now bow.

352
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:01,791
Bow to her!
Do it!

353
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:05,461
She is your rightful leader!

354
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:10,533
- I'm so disappointed in you,
junior.

355
00:21:11,301 --> 00:21:13,469
- Take them away!

356
00:21:13,471 --> 00:21:14,904
- Get your hands off me.

357
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:18,341
You're crushing
my individuality.

358
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:21,677
- All hail the great uniter!

359
00:21:32,823 --> 00:21:35,691
- Are you sure there's no way
they survived?

360
00:21:35,693 --> 00:21:38,427
- Positive, but I think
I can replicate his work

361
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:42,398
With the spirit vines
and get us back on track.

362
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,369
I'll just need an assistant.

363
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:51,274
- How would you like
to help baatar build

364
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,777
The most powerful weapon
the world has ever seen?

365
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:59,348
- It would be my honor,
great uniter.

366
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:06,956
- Begin dismantling
the domes.
