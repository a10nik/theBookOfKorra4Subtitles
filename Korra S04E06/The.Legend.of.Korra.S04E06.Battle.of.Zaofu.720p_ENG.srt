1
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:09,473
- Earth.

2
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:11,375
Fire.

3
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:13,143
Air.

4
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:14,445
Water.

5
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:18,682
Only the avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:22,786
And bring balance
to the world.

7
00:00:26,391 --> 00:00:29,026
- Kuvira threatens
to take zaofu by force.

8
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:31,095
After tensions flared
between su beifong

9
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:34,031
And her former protege,
korra brokered a truce.

10
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:35,032
But it was too late.

11
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,967
Su and her sons were already
on their way

12
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:38,002
To put an end to kuvira.

13
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,970
Meanwhile, bolin and varrick
learned of kuvira's

14
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:42,506
True tyrannical intent
and deserted her army.

15
00:00:42,508 --> 00:00:44,375
But they were captured
and betrayed by zhu li.

16
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,478
Now they're being held
against their will.

17
00:00:57,455 --> 00:01:01,959
- [muffled grunting]

18
00:01:07,432 --> 00:01:08,699
- Are you sure this will work?

19
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,969
Even without kuvira,
they could still crush us.

20
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,537
- Most of this army
has been forced

21
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:14,605
Into service by kuvira.

22
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,474
If we take her out,
they'll have no reason to fight.

23
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:22,580
Tonight we end
her reign of terror.

24
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,566
[heavy footsteps]

25
00:01:56,214 --> 00:01:58,115
She's alone in there.

26
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:02,219
Now's our chance.

27
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:13,330
- Don't hurt me!
- Zhu li?

28
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:17,234
[alarm blaring]

29
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:22,573
- I knew you'd try
a sneak attack.

30
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,975
You were afraid to step up
and lead the earth kingdom

31
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:28,512
When you had the chance,
you were afraid to join me

32
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:29,780
When I became the leader,

33
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:32,449
And now you're afraid
of a fair fight.

34
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:35,552
You've always been a coward.

35
00:02:35,554 --> 00:02:39,256
Take them.

36
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:41,592
- Korra, you have to go stop su

37
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,460
Before she does
something terrible.

38
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:45,529
- Stop her?
We should be helping her!

39
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:49,433
- We have no idea where
your mom is or what her plan is.

40
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,235
If we go charging
into kuvira's camp,

41
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:54,171
We could get them all captured
or worse.

42
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,173
All we can do now is wait.

43
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,141
[loudspeaker feedback]

44
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,076
- Attention,
citizens of zaofu.

45
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:02,780
Your leader, su beifong,
attempted to attack me

46
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:06,984
Tonight while I slept,
ignoring the terms of our truce.

47
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:11,588
Luckily, I now have her
and her assault team in custody.

48
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,423
- No.

49
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,092
- Rest assured
that I will not take revenge

50
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,428
On the peaceful citizens
of zaofu,

51
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,697
As long as
your remaining representatives

52
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,433
Meet me outside the city
at dawn to offer

53
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:27,037
The full and unconditional
surrender of your city.

54
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,838
That is all.

55
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,008
- Korra, you can't let kuvira
get away with this.

56
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,310
We have to go break out
mom and my brothers.

57
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:35,112
- You swore an oath
of nonaggression

58
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,814
When you became an airbender.

59
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,083
You can't just attack kuvira.

60
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,484
- I don't care about the oath.

61
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,319
I have to save my family.

62
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:43,654
- No, jinora is right.

63
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,322
Your mom attacked the camp.

64
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:48,325
Kuvira was
just defending herself.

65
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:49,493
- Defending herself?

66
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,228
She was going
to attack our city!

67
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,630
I can't believe
you're refusing to fight.

68
00:03:53,632 --> 00:03:56,667
- Why is that loudspeaker lady
talking

69
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,737
When I'm trying to sleep?

70
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,271
- Korra,
what are we going to do?

71
00:04:01,273 --> 00:04:03,540
- Jinora and I will go
talk to kuvira at dawn,

72
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:05,375
And maybe we can
work something out.

73
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:09,680
I promise I'll do everything
I can to keep the peace.

74
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:10,814
- I'll go with you.

75
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:12,349
- We'll go, too.
- No.

76
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:15,552
Dad told us to find korra,
and we found her.

77
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:17,287
Now you need to stay safe.

78
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:19,423
- Come on, let us help.

79
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,825
- I can't risk anyone else
being captured.

80
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:23,360
You can stay
with baatar and huan

81
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:25,095
While I work this out
with kuvira.

82
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:26,630
Make sure they get back
to tenzin safely

83
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:29,133
If anything goes wrong.

84
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:29,833
- Aw, man.

85
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:33,570
When am I gonna see
some action?

86
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:38,308
- Cookie jar empty.

87
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,345
No hot towels.

88
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,347
Waxy buildup.

89
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,716
Zhu li!

90
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,417
- [yawns]

91
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:51,588
- Aw, she really is gone.

92
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:56,560
- Up and at 'em, varrick.
Time to go to work.

93
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,595
We have another lab
set up for you.

94
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:01,732
Kuvira wants the spirit vine
weapon operational

95
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:02,866
As soon as possible.

96
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:05,469
- Zhu li always greeted me
in the morning

97
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,437
With a--a hot cup of tea.

98
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,207
- You'll get your tea
when you start working.

99
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,575
- Well,
I'm really only productive

100
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,609
For about 15 minutes a day,

101
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:17,247
Usually in the afternoon
around 3:45.

102
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:18,715
[grunts]
- you'll work now.

103
00:05:18,717 --> 00:05:21,852
I want you to show me
how the device works.

104
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,687
- [yawns]
what's going on?

105
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,989
- Go back to sleep.
We only need varrick.

106
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:29,326
You'll need your energy when you
get to the reeducation camp.

107
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:32,429
- I can't be expected
to work without an assistant.

108
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:34,198
Without zhu li,
I'm helpless.

109
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,301
- One of the guards
will be your assistant.

110
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,302
I'll be supervising.

111
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:39,469
- Well, I guess he'll be fine,

112
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:42,472
As long as he doesn't
need his hands afterwards.

113
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:42,906
[laughs]

114
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:44,708
- What's he talking about, sir?

115
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,810
- The last time we worked
with the spirit vines,

116
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:49,313
It created
an uncontrollable blast

117
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,881
That burned through a wall
and could still be

118
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,749
Blowing up comets in space,
as far as I know.

119
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:56,286
I wouldn't want to assist me
if I were you.

120
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:59,623
- Maybe we should just
let the kid help him out.

121
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,959
- Fine.
Bolin can assist.

122
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,361
- Wait, what? I need my hands!
Uh, hold on.

123
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:10,200
Can we get breakfast first?
While we still have hands?

124
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:22,279
- Release them now!

125
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,716
- If su agrees to bow to me
and turn over zaofu,

126
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,353
She and the rest of your family
will not be harmed.

127
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,922
- Never!
I'll never bow to you!

128
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,791
- There must be some way
for us to resolve this.

129
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:36,627
- I've already laid out
my terms,

130
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,862
And I think
they're very reasonable.

131
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:41,298
After all, su did try
to take me out

132
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,400
During
our peaceful negotiations.

133
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:47,771
- You call bringing an army
to threaten our city peaceful?

134
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:48,605
- Where's bolin?

135
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:50,641
I know he would never
go along with this!

136
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:51,909
- Bolin is with my fiance,

137
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,944
Working on something
very important,

138
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:57,314
But I assure you
he's on board with my plans.

139
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,583
You two have been apart
for some time.

140
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,453
I guess you don't realize
how much bolin has grown up.

141
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:06,390
Now turn over zaofu.

142
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,692
- I can't just let you
take the city.

143
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,528
- Avatar korra,
you are interfering

144
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,897
With internal earth empire
business

145
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:15,832
And letting
your personal feelings

146
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:17,000
Get in the way of reason.

147
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:20,671
Zaofu cannot
continue to rule itself.

148
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,572
They have been hoarding
their riches

149
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:24,007
And technology too long.

150
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:27,277
I'm here to distribute
those resources fairly

151
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,645
Throughout the nation.

152
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:31,014
This is about equality.

153
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:33,383
- You don't care about equality!

154
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:34,785
This is about control!

155
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,752
Just take her down.

156
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:37,521
You know
it's the right thing to do.

157
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,522
You have to stop this!

158
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,525
- The only way you're going
to keep me from marching

159
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,795
Into zaofu
is if you physically stop me.

160
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,396
Now what are you going to do?

161
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:49,967
- It looks like
you're not giving me a choice.

162
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:50,834
- Fine.

163
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:53,704
I want you all to know
that I would never

164
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,105
Ask any of you to do something

165
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,874
That I'm not willing
to do myself.

166
00:07:57,876 --> 00:07:59,910
So rather than risk your lives,

167
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:03,914
I will fight the avatar
one-on-one.

168
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,048
Korra, if you win,

169
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,452
Then you can do
whatever you want with zaofu.

170
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:09,653
But after I beat you,

171
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,089
I want you out of my business
for good.

172
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:16,626
I'm the one who brought peace
to the earth empire, not you.

173
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:18,628
You're not relevant here
anymore.

174
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,831
- Fine.
You want to fight the avatar?

175
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:25,535
Then let's finish this
right here, right now!

176
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:38,482
- Are you really ready
to fight her?

177
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,051
- Just stay back
and let me handle this.

178
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:41,985
It's been a while,

179
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:43,954
But I got
a lot of pent-up rage.

180
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,256
- Don't mess around.
Kuvira is too good.

181
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:49,126
Just go into the avatar state
and get it over with.

182
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:53,797
- No, I'm only going
to use that as a last resort.

183
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,533
- Be careful.

184
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:59,102
[bones crack]

185
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:02,606
- Use whatever you want,
all the elements,

186
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,876
The avatar state,
anything you need.

187
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,678
I know you're a little rusty.

188
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,015
- Enough talk.

- [laughs]

192
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:30,834
Looks like the avatar
is a little off her game.

- [grunts]

194
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,539
- Don't let her
get you frustrated!

195
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,975
She wants you
to make a mistake!

196

[grunting]

197
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:21,351
- Bolin, do the thing.

198
00:10:21,353 --> 00:10:22,986
- What thing?
- The thing!

199
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:25,722
I never had to tell zhu li
what thing!

200
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:26,723
- I'm not zhu li, okay?

201
00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:27,924
Pretend I don't know anything

202
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:29,226
About anything
that's happening here.

203
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,728
Also pretend I don't want
to build a super weapon

204
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,631
Or get my hands blown off.

205
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:41,972
- Walk me through
what you're doing.

206
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,974
I want to know
every detail of your work.

207
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,675
- You know, when I started
working with the vines,

208
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:48,845
The point was to find a clean,
unlimited source of energy,

209
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:51,548
Not develop
some spirity death ray.

210
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,016
- Clean energy,
sounds great!

211
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:56,119
Who doesn't like that stuff?
Let's do that instead.

212
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:56,820
- Quiet.

213
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,889
You're here to help, not talk.

214
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,224
And you of all people
should realize

215
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:03,226
That once a discovery is made,

216
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:04,895
It is our responsibility
as scientists

217
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:08,865
To pursue it as far as we can,
wherever it leads.

218
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:10,033
- How would you know?

219
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:11,401
You couldn't discover
a wolf-bat

220
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:13,970
If it was building a nest
in your butt.

221
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:16,373
- [laughs]
ooh.

222
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,774
- You're pathetic.

223
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:19,976
Wolf-bats don't build nests.

224
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:22,312
- Ooh, you got me there,
dr. Science.

225
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:26,750
You'll never know how it feels
to give birth to genius,

226
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,853
Only to have it kidnapped
and raised by fools.

227
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,121
- Are you done
with your rambling,

228
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,190
Or do the guards
need to encourage you

229
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,758
To continue your work?

230
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,693
- Okay, okay, okay.

231
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,262
The last time we ran
the current through the vine,

232
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:40,564
We couldn't control the power.

233
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:45,969
So I'm trying something new
to see if I can direct it.

234
00:11:56,113 --> 00:11:59,583
- [grunting]

235

[panting]

236
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:39,356
- Come on, avatar.

237
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,290
Get up.

238
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,858
Show me what you've got.

239
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,394
- We have to help her.

240
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,664
- No.
Stay back.

241
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:51,268
I can handle this.

242
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,837
- So I see how the current
interacts with the vine,

243
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,006
And here is
a kind of directional tube,

244
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,941
But this baffling
here at the base...

245
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:58,742
- [sniffs]

246
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,977
- It looks like that would
only redirect the energy

247
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:02,212
Right back where it came from.

248
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,781
And what's that piece of
equipment you're fiddling with

249
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,149
Now on the power source?

250
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:08,151
- Hand me
the screw-turn-thingy, would ya?

251
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:10,487
- Ugh, I can't believe
you're helping them.

252
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,055
You know this isn't right.

253
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,023
- Funny story, bolin.

254
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,825
I first got the idea
for harnessing spirit power

255
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:18,128
When I watched
that giant unalaq monster

256
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,297
Attack the city
from my jail cell.

257
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,233
That giant monster
set me free.

258
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:27,671
Trust me, kid.
I know what I'm doing.

259
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:32,275
[grunts]
that ought to do it.

260
00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:34,678
Huh.

261
00:13:35,246 --> 00:13:37,981
Okay, stand back.

262
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,149
[device beeping]
there we go.

263
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,950
- What's that ticking?

264
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:42,185
- That's the timer.

265
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:43,753
- The timer for what?

266
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:45,288
- For the bomb, of course!

267
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,256
- What?
What bomb?

268
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,391
- The bomb that's going
to explode in five minutes

269
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:51,294
And destroy this entire train,
all of the spirit vines,

270
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:53,897
And everything else
within a few hundred yards.

271
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,866
You know what, I'd get
out of here if I were you.

272
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:58,902
This is the first time
I've built a timer,

273
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,303
And it might run
a little fast.

274
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:02,372
Bolin and I are ready
to go down with the ship--

Or train in this case--

276

But you seem like
you have a lot to live for.

277
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,344
- No, no, no, no!

278
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,245
I'm not ready to go down
with the ship or the train!

279
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:10,313
- You're bluffing.

280
00:14:10,315 --> 00:14:12,048
- Stick around five minutes,

281
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,883
And you'll find out
who's bluffing.

282
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:16,252
You'll be sorry you left me,
zhu li!

283

When they write

Your name will be
synonymous with betrayal!

He varrick'd himself

- Enough.

we'd let you blow yourself up?

290
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,203
You're working for kuvira.

You don't get to quit.

292
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:37,340
Grab him.

293
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:40,176
- You try to pull me away
from this thing,

294

And I'll hit this remote
and blow it immediately.

295

- Why do you have
a timer and a remote?

296
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,083
- Well, first I built the timer,
but then I thought

297
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:49,519
You could drag me off the train,
so then I built a remote.

298

the timer anymore?

00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:21,571
It hurts my eyes
with its raw emotional power.

321
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:29,479
Ah, pedestrian.

322
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,181
I already know what you
look like on the outside.

323
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:36,252
I want you to show me
the inner meelo.

324
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:38,755
- Help!

325
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,490
You have to get korra
and the rest of us

326
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,191
Out of here now!

327
00:17:42,193 --> 00:17:42,759
Hurry!

328
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:46,296
- Finally!
Let's get it on!

329
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:49,632
- This is everyone.
Our half of the train is clear.

330
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:52,435
- That's good.
We're almost out of time.

331
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:53,202
- You're insane.

332
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:55,605
- You knew that
when you hired me.

333
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,674
Bolin, do the thing.

334
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:58,641
- Uh...

335
00:17:58,643 --> 00:17:59,642
- Unhook the cars!

336
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:04,113
Oh, come on,
that was an easy one!

337
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:10,453
- Man, that was great.

338
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:12,355
I gotta admit, you had me
going there for a while.

339
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,691
I really thought
you were going to blow us up.

340
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,426
Now, how do we
turn this thing off?

341
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,662
- Oh, we can't turn it off.
We're going to blow up.

342
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:21,831
But we had a pretty good run,
right?

343
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,399
- What are you talking about,
a good run?

344
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:26,636
I'm still running!
I like running!

345
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:30,306
[whimpering]

346
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:43,453
- I'll see you
on the other side, zhu li.

347
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:47,423
- I want you to know,
I hate you.

348
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:50,693
- [screams]

349
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,535
- I can't believe
he actually blew himself up.

350
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:04,140
That man was crazier
than a sewer-pipe elephant rat.

351
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:07,343
Let's get back to zaofu.

352
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:13,783
[both coughing]

353
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:17,620
- [laughs]

354
00:19:17,622 --> 00:19:19,522
Yes!
You did it, bolin.

355
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:21,324
You did the thing.

356
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,259
Mwah!

357
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:23,926
- I can't believe

358
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:28,031
Zhu li worked for you
as long as she did.

359
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:40,610
- [groaning]

360
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:48,418
- Dive, pepper!
Dive!

361
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,421
Here comes a hurricane!

362
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:56,659
You can't handle
all this meelo!

363
00:19:56,661 --> 00:20:00,329
- We've got her!
Go!

364
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:03,299
- We have to save them!

365
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:05,268
- Opal, get out of here!

366
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,669
We'll be fine!

367
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:07,370
Just go!

368
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:11,174
- I'll be back for you!
I love you!

369
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,509
[pepper groans]

370
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:18,448
- Zaofu is ours!

371
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,451
[all cheering]

372
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:30,727
- Bring the citizens of zaofu
to kneel

373
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,662
Before the great uniter.

374
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:35,231
All who pledge their loyalty
to me

375
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,533
Will keep their freedom
and be dealt with fairly

376
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:40,737
As full citizens
of the earth empire.

377
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,573
The rest will be imprisoned
as traitors,

378
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:47,343
Like su beifong
and her sons.

379
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:49,779
Now bow.

380
00:20:55,552 --> 00:20:57,887
- [groans]

381
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:01,791
Bow to her!
Do it!

382
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:05,461
She is your rightful leader!

383
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:10,533
- I'm so disappointed in you,
junior.

384
00:21:11,301 --> 00:21:13,469
- Take them away!

385
00:21:13,471 --> 00:21:14,904
- Get your hands off me.

386
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:18,341
You're crushing
my individuality.

387
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:21,677
- All hail the great uniter!

388
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,347
[all cheering]

389
00:21:32,823 --> 00:21:35,691
- Are you sure there's no way
they survived?

390
00:21:35,693 --> 00:21:38,427
- Positive, but I think
I can replicate his work

391
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:42,398
With the spirit vines
and get us back on track.

392
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,369
I'll just need an assistant.

393
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:51,274
- How would you like
to help baatar build

394
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,777
The most powerful weapon
the world has ever seen?

395
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:59,348
- It would be my honor,
great uniter.

396
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:06,956
- Begin dismantling
the domes.
